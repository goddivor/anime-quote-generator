1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:06,180
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,780
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,880
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,330
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,980
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,720
One must not commit this act.

7
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,270
To obtain more information about
the transmutation of living organisms,

8
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,190
Ed and Al visited Shou Tucker, the Sewing-Life Alchemist.

9
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,760
At his house, they met his daughter, Nina, and their dog, Alexander.

10
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:21,490
In order to pass the assessment for State Alchemists,
Tucker transmuted a chimera using Nina and Alexander.

11
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,670
Nina will never be able to return to her old self.

12
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,370
Ed was grief-stricken by his powerlessness.

13
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,980
Mom! Mom!

14
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,500
What's the matter, Ed?

15
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,720
A present for you.

16
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,810
I transmuted it myself!

17
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,970
Is that so?

18
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,250
You're Daddy's son, all right.

19
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,990
Thank you.

20
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,860
You're really amazing, Ed.

21
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,320
To be able to make something wonderful like this.

22
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,840
But...

23
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,200
You... couldn't make me correctly, could you...

24
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,970
Onii-chan.

25
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,370
Let's play.

26
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,090
Are you all right, Brother?

27
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,130
Seemed like you were having a nightmare.

28
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,150
What's the matter, you two? Isn't it
a bit early in the morning to be here?

29
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,650
Umm...

30
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,210
So what's going to happen to Tucker and Nina?

31
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,120
Mr. Tucker was supposed to be put on trial
and have his State Alchemist qualifications stripped...

32
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,910
...but both of them died.

33
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,580
"Died"?

34
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,370
I'll go ahead and let you know now, since you'll find out sooner or later.

35
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,710
They were killed.

36
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,470
Why?!

37
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,770
By who?!

38
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,840
We don't know.

39
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,970
I'm about to head to the scene myself.

40
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,720
We're coming with you.

41
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,220
I can't allow you to.

42
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,450
Why not?!

43
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,130
You're better off not seeing it.

44
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,960
Looks like we were a bit late.

45
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,900
We'll have to go after him soon. Or else...

46
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,710
You sound as if you knew this was going to happen.

47
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,710
What's this about?

48
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,970
God has given us a trial!

49
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:42,510
Evil heathens are trying to disturb our faith by spreading absurd rumors, and the military is planning to oppress us!

50
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,760
But we shall not give in!

51
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,160
Take up arms and rise!

52
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,760
In the name of our almighty Sun God, Leto!

53
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,370
That's right! We've got the Sun God Leto on our side!

54
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,100
Shoot the heathens!

55
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,020
Hey! Don't let him trick you!

56
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,860
That bastard has been lying to us!

57
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,940
Shut up!

58
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,610
You guys are agents of the heathens, aren't you!

59
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,620
Humans are oh so silly.

60
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,230
Don't you agree, Gluttony?

61
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,190
Foolish! Foolish!

62
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,760
Yeah, seriously.

63
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,590
Oh my, Sir High Priest.

64
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,110
Sir!

65
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,480
Sorry for giving you so much trouble.

66
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,490
I'll be returning to my assigned town once all of this is over.

67
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,480
The fullmetal boy got in our way, but we were able to make good use of him in the end.

68
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,000
Looks like this'll be over quicker than we'd expected.

69
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,920
All of this happened just because you manipulated a bit of information and I stirred the believers.

70
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,000
Humans are such simple beings.

71
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,700
Blood calls for blood, while hatred begets hatred,

72
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,470
and the energy that comes forth begins to take root in this earth and engraves a crest of blood.

73
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,850
They never learn, no matter how many times history is repeated.

74
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,210
Humans are foolish, sorrowful creatures.

75
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,400
But that's why we can have them play right into our hands, is it not?

76
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,420
Will more people die?

77
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,040
Yes, they will.

78
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,390
Can I eat all the ones that died?

79
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,780
No eating.

80
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,480
In any case Envy, just how much longer do you plan to stay in that form?

81
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,020
It's kind of gross.

82
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,360
Oh come on, I'm just going with the flow.

83
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,960
But I guess it's better to transform into someone young and cute, huh?

84
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,960
M-Monster!!!

85
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,470
What's this?!

86
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,270
The High Priest...

87
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,190
What happened to the real High Priest?!

88
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,340
What do we do?

89
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,780
He called me a monster. How rude.

90
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,290
Can I eat him?

91
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,640
Oh yeah, I heard Shou Tucker from East City was killed.

92
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,250
Tucker?

93
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,830
Ah well, who cares about small fry like him?

94
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,740
Well, the guy who killed him is none other than that guy.

95
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,470
If we're talking about East City, isn't the Flame Colonel stationed there?

96
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,940
Yup. The fullmetal brat is there, too, it seems.

97
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,250
Fullmetal...

98
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,940
It makes me mad that he interfered with our work, but we can't let him die.

99
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,420
He's an important human sacrifice, after all.

100
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,690
Thanks for the meal!

101
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,680
Got it. We'll take care of it somehow.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,560
So, what's that guy's name again?

103
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,560
Scar?

104
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,270
Scarred man...

105
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,100
Yeah. We don't know anything about him,
so that's what we call him.

106
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,770
We have no idea what his aim is, and he's extremely elusive.

107
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,650
All we know about him is that
he has a large scar on his forehead.

108
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,280
I've heard rumors about him, but...

109
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,170
So that's who you guys have been after.

110
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,240
It was on the recommendations from military police headquarters.

111
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,890
I've got so much work from the chamber of military, too.

112
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,220
Seriously, all this is giving me a headache...

113
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:10,680
We've got five casualties so far in Central, ten nationwide. All State Alchemists.

114
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,870
Old man Gran was killed five days ago, too.

115
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,340
Brigadier General Gran?!

116
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,420
He was the lead of weapons transmutation and troop combat divisions!

117
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,810
That's how much trouble this guy really is.

118
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,810
Listen to me. Deploy more guards and stay put for a while.

119
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm asking this as a friend, too.

120
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,140
The only famous alchemists around here were you and Tucker, right?

121
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,810
Shit!

122
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,090
I've always been thinking.
What is this alchemy we believe in?

123
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,630
"Alchemy is understanding the various rules and flow that exist within matter, breaking it down, then rebuilding it."

124
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,330
"This world also flows while abiding by those rules and is in a cycle."

125
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,560
"Death is also a part of that flow. Accept the flow entirely."

126
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,160
That's what our master always said, isn't it?

127
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,620
I thought I understood.

128
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,270
But I didn't.

129
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,280
That's why we transmuted Mom...

130
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,030
And even now, I'm thinking whether I could somehow fix something that's impossible.

131
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,270
I'm an idiot.

132
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,270
I haven't grown one bit since that time.

133
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,990
I thought that rain would wash away these pent-up feelings...

134
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,670
But every drop that hits my face makes me more miserable.

135
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,430
I can't even feel the rain hitting my skin because I have no body.

136
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,630
That by itself is lonely and cruel.

137
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,980
I still want to return to my old body. I want to become human again.

138
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,310
Even if it's impossible and is against the ways of this world.

139
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,910
You're Edward Elric, the "Fullmetal Alchemist", aren't you?

140
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,900
Brother!

141
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,290
What the hell is this about?!

142
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,230
Who the hell is this guy?

143
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,100
This is bad... This is bad!

144
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,410
I've got to get away!

145
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,230
This is bad... This is bad!

146
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,810
Al, run!

147
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,740
I won't let you get away!

148
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,320
Brother!

149
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,590
Al, hang on!

150
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,730
Dammit, what the hell?!

151
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,720
I haven't done anything to set anyone against me-

152
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,230
Scratch that, I've done a lot.

153
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,320
I haven't given anyone reason to go after my life, though!

154
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,500
Oww...

155
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,250
Who the hell are you? Why are you after us?!

156
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,140
Think of it this way.

157
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,510
If there is someone who created you,
then there is someone who will destroy you, as well.

158
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,030
Looks like there's no getting out of this.

159
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,020
You've got some guts.

160
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,430
But...

161
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,680
Too slow.

162
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,450
Al!

163
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,800
It's empty?

164
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,380
You bastard!!!

165
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,930
Too slow!

166
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,380
Dammit!

167
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,010
Automail...

168
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,060
Makes sense. I wouldn't be able to
destroy it with human destruction.

169
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,900
You guys are something else.

170
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,690
No, Brother!

171
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,830
You should run!

172
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,020
Idiot! How can I leave you behind and run?!

173
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,710
So you transmute by placing your hands together and forming a circle.

174
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,070
In that case...

175
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,830
I'll be destroying this annoying arm of yours, first.

176
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,500
Brother!!!

177
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,840
Now you can't use alchemy anymore.

178
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,180
I'll give you a bit of time to pray to God.

179
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,390
Brother, run! Brother!

180
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,320
Unfortunately, there isn't a god I want to pray to.

181
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,070
Am I the only one you're after?

182
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,340
Are you going to kill my brother... Al... too?

183
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,280
I will, if he decides to interfere.

184
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,580
But the only one to receive judgment
at my hands is the Fullmetal Alchemist... You...

185
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,040
All right...

186
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,270
Then promise me.

187
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,750
That you won't lay a finger on my little brother!

188
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,040
Brother...

189
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,670
I'll keep my word.

190
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,180
What are you saying... Brother?

191
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,220
What are you doing? Get out of there?!

192
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,430
Get up and run!

193
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,830
Stop it... Stop it.

194
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,050
Stop it! You bastard!!!

195
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,670
That's far enough.

196
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,190
You've made quite a mess of things, Scar.

197
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,480
I'll be taking you into custody under the offense of murdering a series of State Alchemists.

198
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,530
Alchemists are beings who alter the original form of matter.

199
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:23,000
In other words, an affront God, the creator of all.

200
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,420
I bring judgment, acting as God's hand.

201
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,630
If you choose to get in my way, I will eliminate you, as well.

202
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,640
Interesting.

203
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,820
I don't want any of you interfering in this.

204
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,020
Colonel Mustang!

205
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,270
Mustang... The Flame Alchemist.

206
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,980
You came to me to receive judgment,
saving me the effort of having to search for you.

207
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,980
What a splendid day!

208
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,740
You know my name, yet you're picking a fight with me?

209
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,950
What a fool.

210
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,560
What was that for?!

211
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,310
Colonel, please stay back.

212
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,750
You're impotent on rainy days, after all.

213
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,530
Oh right, I guess you can't make sparks when it's wet like this.

214
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,260
It's awfully convenient for me if you can't make flames, State Alchemist.

215
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,390
I will destroy all here who interfere with my duty!

216
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,600
We'll just see about that!

217
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,390
Reinforcements?!

218
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,020
You're quite good to be able to dodge my fist.

219
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,150
You said you'd destroy everyone here, no?

220
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,900
Then try defeating me, first!

221
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,660
The Strong Arm Alchemist, Alex Louis Armstrong!!!

222
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,760
One after another...

223
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,160
This must be divine guidance, as well.

224
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,560
So you won't retreat, huh?

225
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,920
To show deference to that courage, I'll show you...

226
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,430
...a skill that has been passed down the Armstrong household for generations... Artistic Alchemy!

227
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,270
Who is he?

228
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,210
He's the one who murdered Mr. Tucker.

229
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,770
It was him ?!

230
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,390
Major! Please try not to destroy too much of the city!

231
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,530
What are you saying?!

232
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,160
Destruction and creation are like two sides of the same coin!

233
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,280
You destroy and create! This, in other words,
is the law of the universe!

234
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,870
But why naked...

235
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,780
That logic is crazy...

236
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,610
But other Alchemists won't find it crazy, though.

237
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,800
Right, Scar?

238
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,570
So he's an Alchemist, too...

239
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:39,060
I see. The three transmutation processes in Alchemy are understanding, decomposition, and reconstruction.

240
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,750
But he stops at the point of decomposition.

241
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,060
He's an alchemist, too?

242
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,400
Then he is going against "God's path", isn't he?!

243
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,570
But... why is he only after those who possess a state qualification?

244
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,540
Agility that wouldn't be expected from
his build and inhuman destructive power.

245
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,570
And on top of that, alchemy...

246
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,750
He's certainly troublesome, but...

247
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,720
Now you're stuck!

248
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,130
...this is when he takes a big swing!

249
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,510
Right here!

250
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,120
He pulled back?!

251
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,610
Did you get him?!

252
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,800
He's fast.

253
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,230
Just one hit, a graze.

254
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,740
Brown skin and red eyes?!

255
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,740
An Ishbalan?!

256
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,240
Looks like I'm surrounded...

257
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,200
Hey now, don't move-

258
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,830
Damn, the bastard escaped into the sewers...

259
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,570
Don't go after him.

260
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,720
Like I'd go after a dangerous guy like that.

261
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,550
Sorry about that.

262
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,930
You bought enough time for us to surround him, and yet...

263
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:09,240
No, I was more concerned with
staying alive rather than buying time.

264
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,750
Oh, is it over?

265
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,720
Lt. Colonel Hughes, where have you been?

266
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,320
I was taking cover.

267
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,670
Hey! Why didn't you at least give support or something?!

268
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:23,740
Shut up! Don't drag an ordinary guy like me
into you nonsensical mutants' all-around freak shows!

269
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,750
What are you gazing off into space for?! Don't you guys have work to do?!

270
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,310
Emergency deployments within the city! And be sure to whip up a description about the suspect, too!

271
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,970
Yes, sir!

272
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,580
Alphonse...

273
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,670
Alphonse!

274
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,090
Al! Are you all right?! Hey!

275
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,730
So that's Elric's younger brother...

276
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,350
Looks like they've got their own issues...

277
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,230
Al! Alphonse!

278
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,230
Why didn't you run away when
I told you to, you stupid brother!

279
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,980
Come on, I couldn't leave you behind and run away!

280
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,980
That's exactly why I'm calling you stupid!

281
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,990
What?! If I ran away, you might have been killed!

282
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,250
I might have not been killed, too!

283
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,210
Only an idiot would choose the path that leads to death!

284
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,470
Quit calling your brother an idiot!

285
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,750
I'll say it as many times as I want!

286
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,580
If you'd lived, continued to live, and survived,

287
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,860
and continued to study alchemy,

288
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,660
you could have found a way to get your limbs back
and maybe discovered how to save people like Nina!

289
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,600
I wouldn't be able to forgive you if you chose to die by throwing all of those possibilities away!

290
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,010
My arm came off! You stupid brother!

291
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,650
We're really torn up, aren't we...

292
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,280
How uncool.

293
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,260
But... we're alive.

294
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah. We sure are.

295
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,050
This seriously is a special all-around freak show, isn't it.

296
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,210
Sorry for keeping it from you.

297
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,210
No problem, I won't tell the higher-ups.

298
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,470
It'll be somewhat troublesome if they find out, won't it?

299
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,330
Yeah...

300
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,430
We can play off the part about Edward's limbs,
but we can't really make up an excuse for the younger one.

301
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,110
But seriously... we've got quite the ugly customer coming after us.

302
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,620
An Ishbalan, huh...

303
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:31,870
Ishbalans were a tribe of people in the East
who worshipped Ishvala as their sole creator and God.

304
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,880
There were a few cases of feuds after we annexed the country,

305
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,050
But thirteen years ago...

306
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:45,360
...when a military officer mistakenly shot and killed
an Ishbalan child, the situation devolved into a civil war.

307
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:55,230
A riot called forth more riots, and the civil war eventually spread throughout all of the east.

308
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,840
The order given from the highest level of
our military after seven years of battle was...

309
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,950
...Ishbalan extermination.

310
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,610
Many State Alchemists were roped in to act as human weapons.

311
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,770
And the State Alchemists brought forth remarkable achievements.

312
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,880
That's why that man, who is a survivor of the Ishbalans, has a legitimate reason for wanting revenge.

313
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,810
Bullshit!

314
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:33,430
There's no legitimacy in revenge that drags in people who have nothing to do with it!

315
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:38,770
All he's doing is sugar-coating an ugly spirit of vengeance by calling himself God's hand and pretending to be all noble!

316
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,320
But the hard truth is he's hostile toward us.

317
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,280
And we can't die, either.

318
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,160
The next time we see him, we'll crush him...

319
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,490
...without any questions asked.

320
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,410
Yes, sir!

321
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:57,420
Ed, Al, what do you two plan on doing now?

322
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,760
We're going to move forward again.

323
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,920
We can't come to a stop as long as we're alive, after all!

324
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,320
Brother...

325
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,590
First off, I need to get my arm fixed in order to get your body back to normal.

326
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,620
Since I'm the only one who knows how to affix a soul to an armor.

327
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,500
You're right about that!

328
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,980
Guess we've got no choice.

329
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,230
What do you say we go and visit our mechanic?

330
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,730
We haven't shown our faces there in a while.

331
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:06,850
Winry's smile greets Ed and Al, who return
to Resembool to rest their battle-wounded bodies.

332
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:13,430
On the other hand, a philosopher's stone
appears before them, shrouded in a deep mystery.

333
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,890
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

334
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,490
Episode 6, The Road of Hope.

335
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,020
The wind blows through the hill in the sunset.
What does it bring the boy?
