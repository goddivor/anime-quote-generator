1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,130
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:11,740
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,530
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,290
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,890
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,210
One must not commit this act.

7
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,140
To you, children of God, who live on this earth,

8
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,800
pray and believe, and you shall be saved.

9
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,810
The Sun God Leto shines light upon you to show you the way.

10
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,810
Are you guys street performers or something?

11
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,420
Where in the world did you get that idea?

12
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,690
Am I wrong?

13
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,030
Thanks for the meal.

14
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,970
Hey now, sir!

15
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,220
Sorry about that, we'll fix it.

16
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,790
"Fix", you say?

17
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,290
Well, just watch.

18
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,630
Well then, here I go!

19
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,600
How's that?

20
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,510
Now that's quite a surprise.

21
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,030
You're able to perform miracles, as well?

22
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,390
What the heck are you talking about?

23
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,420
We're alchemists.

24
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,150
That's the first time I've seen anything like that.

25
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,480
You've never heard of us, the Elric Brothers, before?

26
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,180
"Elric"?

27
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,960
Actually, I have.

28
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,740
The Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric!

29
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,430
Oh, so you're that rumored genius alchemist.

30
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,260
Ah, I get it! Your other name is "Fullmetal" because of this suit!

31
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,290
No... You have the wrong person...

32
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,920
Huh? That little guy over there?

33
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,630
Who are you calling a pea-sized runt?!

34
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,720
Pray and believe...

35
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,630
So, what the heck is this broadcast?

36
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,550
I-It's the High Priest Cornello...

37
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,500
He came here a few years ago and preached to us about the path of God.

38
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,730
"God will grant eternity to the living and resurrection to the dead."

39
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,070
And proof of it all are the miracles that he produces.

40
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,920
"Resurrection to the dead", eh?

41
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,820
Sounds fishy to me.

42
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,880
That's what they were talking about, huh?

43
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,170
What do you think?

44
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,680
It's pretty obvious from that transmutation response that it's alchemy.

45
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,550
But he's totally ignoring the concept of equivalent exchange.

46
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,180
It's a rule that you can only produce something from matter of equal value.

47
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,720
He changed a flower to a mineral, too.

48
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,960
Brother, could it be...

49
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Yeah. It could be...

50
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,250
Bingo.

51
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,870
God... please listen to my wish...

52
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,580
Please bring back-

53
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,960
Ah, so this is Mr. Leto.

54
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,130
Are you interested in the religion of Leto?

55
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,130
Nah. Unfortunately, I'm an atheist.

56
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,910
That's not good.

57
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,680
Believing and honoring God,
and living in gratitude and hope...

58
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,030
How glorious.

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,100
If you believe...

60
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,940
I'm sure you'll grow taller!

61
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,330
What did you say?!

62
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,650
She didn't mean it in a bad way!

63
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,940
"Resurrection to the dead"...

64
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,720
Do you seriously believe something like that?

65
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,330
Yes.

66
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,860
Water, 35L.

67
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,450
Carbon, 20kg.

68
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,950
Ammonia, 4L.

69
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,880
Lime, 1.5kg.

70
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,540
Phosphorus, 800g.

71
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,250
Salt, 250g.

72
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,550
Niter, 100g.

73
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,290
And others.

74
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,380
...What?

75
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,480
Those are the ingredients that make up an average adult human body.

76
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,150
We know this from our advances in science, but there
haven't been any reports of successful human transmutations.

77
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,530
You really think that praying would solve something that even science couldn't solve?

78
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,910
"Pray and believe, and your wishes shall be."

79
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,030
And by the way,

80
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,660
you can buy these basic ingredients at the market with a kid's pocket money.

81
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,580
Humans are made pretty cheaply, aren't they?

82
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,370
People are not things. Those words are blasphemy to our creator.

83
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,820
You'll suffer divine punishment for that.

84
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,050
Alchemists are scientists, after all.

85
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,730
We don't believe in creators or the existence of a God.

86
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,730
Looking for the solution to the creation principle of this world and pursuing the truth.

87
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:25,190
It's pretty ironic we're the closest things to God
in a sense, even though we have no need for him.

88
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,390
Are you saying you're on the same level as God?

89
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,950
How arrogant!

90
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,940
Arrogant, huh?

91
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,810
I remember this from a mythical tale.

92
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:41,960
"The hero who gets too close to the sun shall have
his wax wings plucked and be dropped to the earth."

93
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,550
Brother.

94
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,470
Lady, will Mr. Leto save a scientist like me?
Even though I was thinking something like that?

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,970
Of course. He will accept reformers at any time.

96
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,480
High Priest, there are people who wish to have a meeting with you.

97
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,000
Two of them. A child and a man in a suit of armor.

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,470
They call themselves the "Elric Brothers".

99
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,160
I'm busy. Dismiss them.

100
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,330
Actually, wait... Did you say... the Elric Brothers?

101
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,150
Yes, that's what they said...

102
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,220
This is going to be trouble.
It's the Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric.

103
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,990
The... man in the armor?!

104
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,790
Yeah, probably.

105
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,700
What is a State Alchemist doing here?

106
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,260
Could it be that our plan has been...

107
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,260
Those dogs of the military must have a good sense of smell.

108
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,800
This way, please.

109
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,610
The High Priest is a very busy man, and he usually cannot find time for such matters, but...

110
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,270
You folks are lucky.

111
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,430
Sorry for the trouble. I'll try to make it quick.

112
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,980
Yeah, let's get this over with as quickly as possible.

113
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,550
Priest, what are you doing?!

114
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:59,100
Rose, these people are heathens who are trying to ensnare the High Priest. They are evil.

115
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,110
No, that's...

116
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,750
So... let's get this over with quick!

117
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,260
Strike!

118
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,630
So noisy!

119
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,370
Welcome to the holy order, Fullmetal Alchemist.

120
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,850
Sir Cornello!

121
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,970
Looks like some of us were rather hasty.

122
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,890
I apologize for their rudeness.

123
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,530
It really doesn't feel like an apology when you're looking down at us from a high place like that.

124
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,530
Are you here for our dogma?

125
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:40,480
I have a lot of things I want to learn from you... say,
a method for tricking your followers with petty alchemy.

126
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,400
I have no idea what you're talking about.

127
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,000
I can't have you putting my miracles and alchemy on the same level.

128
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,510
How's this? Can this be achieved through alchemy?

129
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,430
That's precisely what I'm concerned about.

130
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,760
For some strange reason, you can perform
transmutations while clearly ignoring the rules.

131
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,260
Which is why it isn't alchemy-

132
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,710
So I was thinking...

133
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:12,450
If you had the legendary amplifier that allows alchemists to perform the impossible, it would be possible in your case.

134
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,290
What?

135
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,450
Yep. Frankly, the Philosopher's Stone. Isn't that what your ring is made of?

136
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,970
That was a long search.

137
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,290
This is just an ordinary ring.

138
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,620
God has allowed me to perform miracles.

139
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,770
Still gonna play dumb?

140
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,380
Guess I'll have to get my hands on you and ask your body for the truth.

141
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,320
You seem to be an incorrigible heathen.

142
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,880
Rose.

143
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,430
Y-Yes?

144
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,390
Pick up that pistol.

145
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,640
Yes, sir...

146
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,150
Now shoot the Fullmetal Alchemist.

147
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,030
I... can't do that...

148
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,830
My words are God's words.

149
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,080
This is God's will.

150
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,030
Rose, shoot him.

151
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,780
What's wrong?

152
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,540
Who was the one...

153
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,630
...who rescued you from your despair
after you lost your love in an accident last year?

154
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,880
It was you, Sir Cornello...

155
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,620
That's right. It was I who rescued you.

156
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,640
And what did I promise you?

157
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,140
That you'd revive him!

158
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,190
Umm... I'm not the one you're supposed to be aiming at...

159
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,940
I'm the Fullmetal Alchemist, got it?!

160
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,070
Wait, you're the one?!

161
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,200
Sorry... I have to.

162
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,950
He's a swindler.

163
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,780
No, he isn't!

164
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,330
He's going to revive him with his miracles!

165
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,830
Then shoot me.

166
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,900
Al!

167
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,450
Good work. God is rejoicing.

168
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,890
Now, shoot the other.

169
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,900
Man, you make your followers do terrible things.

170
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,810
What?!

171
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,320
What's going on?!

172
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,420
As you can see...

173
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,820
...this is how it is.

174
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,890
An empty suit of armor!

175
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,270
This, itself, is evidence of their evil!

176
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,680
They must be eliminated!

177
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,090
Is this your first time seeing a chimera?

178
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,760
So you made something like this with your Philosopher's Stone, too, eh?

179
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,900
I should probably arm myself...

180
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,590
Without a transmutation circle?!

181
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,330
I guess your title of "State Alchemist" has to come with something!

182
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,030
But...

183
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,200
How do you like those claws that cut through iron?!

184
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,250
Just kidding.

185
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,670
Unfortunately, my leg is a bit special.

186
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,180
Bite him to death!

187
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,920
What's wrong, stupid cat?

188
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,760
Get a good taste of it!

189
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,810
That arm...

190
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,810
...and a brother without his body...

191
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,570
Ah, I see now.

192
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,400
Fullmetal Alchemist... you...

193
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,910
You've done it, haven't you?!

194
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,440
Get down here, third-rate!

195
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,950
I'll show you the difference in our skill!

196
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,210
Get down here, third-rate!

197
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,550
I'll show you the difference in our skill!

198
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:07,570
Rose, these guys have committed the greatest taboo alchemists can commit.

199
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,400
Human transmutation.

200
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,680
They tried to revive the dead.

201
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,220
"The hero who gets too close to the sun shall have
his wax wings plucked and be dropped to the earth."

202
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,230
No way...

203
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,850
This is the body of a sinner who encroached upon God's territory.

204
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,250
Rose, are you really prepared to be like this?

205
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,620
Edward Elric.

206
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,750
And you call yourself a State Alchemist? You make me laugh.

207
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,250
Shut the hell up!

208
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,050
You can't do anything without
the Philosopher's Stone, third-rate!

209
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,260
High Priest, please give us the stone before you get hurt.

210
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,810
How ridiculous! Fools who stepped into God's territory!

211
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,020
I'll send you to his side, once and for all!

212
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:07,400
Nah, God seems to hate me,
so he'll probably send me back even if I went.

213
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,120
Al!

214
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,210
What are you doing?! After them!

215
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,460
They are heathens who bring evil to the order! Catch them!

216
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,030
Stop right there!

217
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,770
What do you think you can do unarmed, kid?

218
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,660
Just give up before you get hurt.

219
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,690
Don't let your guard down just because he's a kid!

220
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,360
Out of the way!

221
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,370
Get it now, Rose?

222
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,780
Cornello shot at us, even though you were with us.

223
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,790
But that's because you two...

224
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,300
Is that story true?

225
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,550
We just wanted to see Mom's smiling face again.

226
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,930
But the transmutation failed.

227
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,970
It didn't even look human.

228
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,200
We learned our mistake the hard way.

229
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,900
People cannot be revived... even our mom.

230
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,520
That's not true... because...

231
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,240
The fundamental basis of alchemy is the concept of equivalent exchange.

232
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,300
The price we paid for the human transmutation was huge.

233
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,410
Brother lost his left leg, and I lost my body.

234
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,520
Can you see it?

235
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,670
Brother drew it with his blood.

236
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,950
It must have been painful for him,
after having his left leg taken away.

237
00:15:53,510 --> 00:16:01,020
But Brother affixed my soul to this suit and gave up his right arm as compensation.

238
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,600
I want to fix my brother's body.

239
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,440
Brother wants to get my body back, too.

240
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,410
But we may die trying.

241
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,450
That's the path we've chosen.

242
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,350
But, Sir Cornello could...

243
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,620
Rose...

244
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,610
Even if you two can't, he could...

245
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,650
He could do it! He will!

246
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,680
You brat! You'd better be prepared!

247
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,560
Old man, let's have a heart-to-heart talk.

248
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,280
I just want to know the secret behind that stone.

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,840
Or should I call for the army to mobilize?

250
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,690
To inspect the stone, that is.

251
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,440
Fine.

252
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,350
What do you plan to do with the Philosopher's Stone?

253
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,530
You don't need that pitiful order if you have the stone, do you?

254
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:04,910
The order will produce followers that will joyfully give up their lives for me!

255
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,000
They would be an undefeatable army that does not fear even death.

256
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,420
Just watch.

257
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,440
I'm going to be stripping this country away in a few years.

258
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,650
By using the Philosopher's Stone and my stupid followers!

259
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,240
I guess I could share some of the leftovers with you.

260
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,980
What's so funny?!

261
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,610
This is why I called you third-rate.

262
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,950
Y...

263
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,220
You didn't...

264
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,960
There are no such things as miracles.

265
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,530
They were all thanks to the power of the Philosopher's Stone.

266
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,370
Y-You...

267
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,960
When did you flip on that switch?!

268
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,980
When?!

269
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,960
From the very beginning.

270
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
It's all been leaked, now.

271
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
What have you done?!

272
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,160
You brat!!!

273
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,550
Too slow!

274
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,220
Told ya. We're on totally different levels.

275
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,190
I'm invincible!

276
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,240
R-Rebound!

277
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,910
I'm not giving up yet!

278
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,430
I'm... I'm...

279
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,070
God's hand!!!

280
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,400
My words are God's words. This fist is God's fist!

281
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,420
"God's fist", you say?!

282
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,200
If you like it so much, I'll let you have a taste of it!

283
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,860
Shut up!

284
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,800
Now give me the Philosopher's Stone!

285
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,540
It... broke? What does this mean?

286
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,090
How could the Philosopher's Stone break? It's supposed to be a perfect substance!

287
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,190
I... I don't know!

288
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,770
I didn't hear about this!

289
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,020
P-P-P-Please don't hurt me!

290
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,230
Please! I was wrong!

291
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,910
So it was a fake?

292
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,790
I can't do anything without the stone! Please, have mercy!!!

293
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,120
I finally thought we'd be able to get our bodies back, and it's...

294
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,540
...fake...

295
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,420
U-Umm, what about me?

296
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,090
Go wherever you want!!!

297
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,430
Yes, sir!

298
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,760
What about the Philosopher's Stone?

299
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,180
It was a fake.

300
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,600
I see...

301
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,830
And I thought we'd finally be able to get your body back...

302
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,430
Give me the Philosopher's Stone!

303
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,360
Rose...

304
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,730
Didn't I just say that it was a fake?

305
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,700
And in any case, it broke on its own.

306
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,520
That's a lie!

307
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,160
You're planning to keep it for yourselves, aren't you!

308
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,710
To fix your bodies... right?!

309
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,640
And you want to meet your mother again, too...

310
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,790
Shut up!

311
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,580
The dead cannot be revived...

312
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,880
Never...

313
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,880
Never.

314
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,630
But he said that he'd be able to bring him back...

315
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,140
He said that if I prayed, it would come true.

316
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,450
That a miracle would occur...

317
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,270
What am I supposed to cling to from now on?!

318
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,250
Tell me!

319
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,030
Hey...

320
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,660
Decide that for yourself.

321
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,920
Get up and take a step. Walk forward.

322
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,040
You've got two fine legs on you.

323
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,240
You don't need to cling to anything.

324
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,530
What's going on?!

325
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,380
Let us see the High Priest!

326
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,320
Were you guys tricking us?!

327
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,770
Open this door!!!

328
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,910
My plans... ruined by a brat like that...

329
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,440
Seriously. What a mess.

330
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,530
All you had to do was to wreak a bit of havoc.

331
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,940
You...

332
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,310
Hey, Lust?

333
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,450
Can I eat this guy?

334
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,560
No, Gluttony.

335
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,950
If you eat something like that, you'll get a stomachache.

336
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,000
How dare... How dare you all make fun of me!

337
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,920
You're not needed anymore.

338
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,210
It was just starting to liven up, too.

339
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,810
I guess we have to start over.

340
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,310
Father will get mad at us.

341
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,860
Now, I wonder what we should do next...

342
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:06,340
Ed and Al visit East City, home of Eastern Headquarters, to report the incident in Lior.

343
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,260
And they meet Shou Tucker,
the Sewing-Life Alchemist, and his daughter, Nina.

344
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,760
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

345
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,770
Episode 4, An Alchemist's Distress.

346
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,800
An encounter. Is that the beginning of suffering?
