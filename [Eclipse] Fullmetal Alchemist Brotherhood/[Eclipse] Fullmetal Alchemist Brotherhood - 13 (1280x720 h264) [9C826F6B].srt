1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,020
But I'm amazed you were able to come back alive after seeing that thing.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,810
To be expected of my student, I guess.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,050
That's...

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,190
But rules are rules.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,610
You're expelled.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,860
Master-

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,470
Al.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,730
The trains are still running.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,060
Go home.

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,420
Thanks... for everything.

11
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,240
Drop by if you're ever in the neighborhood.

12
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,310
But we're...

13
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,190
Idiot!

14
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,210
If you aren't in a master-student relationship anymore,

15
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,770
it means that from now on,
you're going to treat each other as individuals.

16
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,080
What's holding you back?

17
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,330
Dammit!

18
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,790
Al! What did we come to Dublith for?

19
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,060
Mr. Sig, we're going to head back!

20
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,840
Don't let her kill you.

21
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,340
Master!

22
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,520
What did you come back for?!

23
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,470
Who are you calling Master?!

24
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,400
You guys aren't my students anymore!

25
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,270
Go home already!

26
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,190
Master!

27
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,410
We came here to find clues on how to get our bodies back.

28
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,940
We can't go back with nothing.

29
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,440
Go home!

30
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,820
We won't!

31
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,750
Morons...

32
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,250
You didn't see the truth, did you, Al?

33
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,110
No. I have no idea what you mean...

34
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,020
Maybe you lost your memories due to shock.

35
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,910
How about we try retrieving your memories?

36
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,010
You had your whole body taken.

37
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,510
There's no way you didn't see it.

38
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,060
I get it!

39
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:36,980
You and I only had parts of our bodies taken, so if it's based on how much we paid, Al should know the most of the truth!

40
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,460
So if we can get my memories back, we might find a clue on how to get our bodies back...

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,430
But memories of that thing, huh?

42
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,470
That thing, huh?

43
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,210
Huh? Could this be bad?

44
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,390
More like... extraordinary?

45
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,310
Yeah, you could call it that.

46
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,890
Your mind might explode...

47
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,540
If you screw up, it could destroy you...

48
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,550
But if it'll let us find a clue...

49
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,340
I want to do it!

50
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,320
Fine.

51
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,470
Let me ask a friend of mine how to regain one's memories.

52
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,110
But before that, let's eat.

53
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,980
You'd better help out.

54
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,280
Yes, ma'am!

55
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,570
No doubt about it. That's the guy who affixed a soul.

56
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,750
East City
Eastern Headquarters

57
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,130
You'll be working in Central starting next week.

58
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,630
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,370
It'll become quiet around here.

60
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,980
You were quite the flashy one.

61
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,640
Not anywhere near as flashy as you were in your prime, sir.

62
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,020
I was able to relax because you worked so hard.

63
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,200
But I also learned a lot from all of those jobs you gave me.

64
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,080
Check.

65
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,380
I was finally able to beat you.

66
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,450
Let's call this victory a parting gift.

67
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,340
General.

68
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,270
I'd also like to ask for another gift.

69
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,980
Sgt. Major Kain Fuery.

70
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,420
Warrant Officer Vato Falman.

71
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,790
2nd Lt. Heymans Breda.

72
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,350
2nd Lt. Jean Havoc.

73
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,380
Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye.

74
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,690
The five of you will be transferring to Central with me.

75
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,790
I won't take any complaints.

76
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,610
Come with me!

77
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,570
Colonel, I can't.

78
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,260
I just recently found a girlfriend.

79
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,330
Break up with her.

80
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,490
Again?!

81
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,440
Your wounds haven't even healed yet.

82
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,410
Master...

83
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,890
I'm so happy to see you're well.

84
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,910
I heard rumors about you going around killing State Alchemists.

85
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,690
I understand your resentment.

86
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,110
The ones who annihilated our village were State Alchemists.

87
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,670
But all revenge does is give birth to more revenge.

88
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,040
A futile chain like that must be stopped immediately.

89
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,660
You must persevere.

90
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,560
Sorry to interrupt.

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,890
Whoa, he really was here!

92
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,460
An Ishbalan with a cross scar on his forehead.

93
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,940
We're splitting the prize money like we agreed, Mr. Yoki.

94
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,530
Huh? Where's Mr. Yoki?

95
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,520
Hey!

96
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,910
What's this all about?

97
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,980
You had nowhere to go, so we treated you like family-

98
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,010
Shut up!

99
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,240
Don't go comparing me with you Ishbalans!

100
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,990
I'm going to rise again!

101
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:24,240
I'm going to keep rising and rising,
and eventually get rid of that damned Edward Elric!

102
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,130
Now you two, please do your thing.

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,070
Seems I'll only bring trouble while I'm here.

104
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,890
You're an obedient one.

105
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,350
Y-You bastard! What did you do?!

106
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,690
I'll give you some time to pray to God.

107
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,530
G-God? You seriously think I believe-

108
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,670
Wait!

109
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,600
Stay away!

110
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,990
I-I was wrong!

111
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,210
Please spare my life!

112
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll follow you forever!

113
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,170
Are you going?

114
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,450
You'll sadden your brother.

115
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,220
There's no going back for me.

116
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,840
Here he comes.

117
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,950
We were waiting for you, guest.

118
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,880
"We know your secret."

119
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,600
"Come to Devil's Nest."

120
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,600
Are you the ones who know this "secret"?

121
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,190
We sure are. We know quite a lot.

122
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,190
I also want to know my own secret.

123
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,890
Then it's settled.

124
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,280
Follow me.

125
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,040
But my master taught me not to follow strangers.

126
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,450
How old are you?

127
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,700
Fourteen.

128
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,710
If you're fourteen, shouldn't you be able to make your own decisions?

129
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,820
You can't be saying things like "master taught me" forever.

130
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,720
I see! I have to make my own decisions then, huh?

131
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,020
That's right!

132
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,050
So come with-

133
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,930
So I decided to tie you guys up and beat the secrets out of you.

134
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,100
So in the end, you chose force.

135
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,950
I'm coming in!

136
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,490
Y-You're inside-

137
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,910
Hey, stay put!

138
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,010
How does it feel to have your body controlled from the inside?

139
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,780
Even if you do this, you can't stop my movements completely!

140
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,250
You're right. But...

141
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,980
As long as I can restrict your movements just a bit...

142
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,010
We can win the fight.

143
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,890
Did I hurt you?

144
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,850
I hit my head.

145
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,390
Giving us trouble...

146
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,670
Who are you guys...

147
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,750
They're chimeras.

148
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,240
My henchmen.

149
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,680
Wow, that's so cool! You really are empty.

150
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,730
I'm Greed.

151
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,590
Let's try to get along.

152
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,550
What are you guys, really?

153
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,810
You were lying about being chimeras, right?

154
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,710
There's no way chimeras can talk!

155
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,310
There's no way "there's no way".

156
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,400
Since this girl who's inside you right now is a chimera that was transmuted with a snake.

157
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,510
And Loa, who's behind me... What are you again?

158
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,000
A cow?

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,030
Yes.

160
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,450
Other than that, we've got a lizard and a crocodile.

161
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,090
The guy you fought earlier takes a piss with one leg up.

162
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,420
I do not!

163
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,190
You're a dog?

164
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,420
Yeah. It's pretty useful.

165
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,870
No way...

166
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,500
That can't be true!

167
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,180
And besides, who are you going to say performed the transmutation successfully?

168
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,680
The army.

169
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,240
No way...

170
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,710
Anyway, it just means there's a flip side to this world that society doesn't know about.

171
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,490
On a different note, I'm not a chimera.

172
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,110
I'm a homunculus.

173
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,740
Homunculus?!

174
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,170
You've heard of them, haven't you?

175
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,630
Humans that were created artificially.

176
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,780
That's what I am.

177
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,400
Homunculus?

178
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,440
It's another name for an android.

179
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,420
But it's said in the book that you're not allowed to create humans.

180
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,720
You're lying!

181
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,420
I've never even heard of anyone creating a homunculus!

182
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,050
Geez...

183
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,700
Let me show you some proof.

184
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,070
W-What did you do that for?!

185
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,910
That's one death for me.

186
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,600
No way...

187
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,950
Do you understand now?

188
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,290
There's no way "there's no way".

189
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,190
Besides, aren't you living proof of that?

190
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,900
An existence with a soul and no body.

191
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,930
How did you...

192
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,060
I know just about everything that goes on in this other world.

193
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,430
Let's get to the point.

194
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,860
How does it feel to be immortal with just a soul?

195
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,990
Transmuting a soul and affixing it to another object.

196
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,530
If you do it correctly, that person can gain eternal life.

197
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,070
Am I wrong?

198
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,660
I'm Greed.

199
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,750
I'm greedy,

200
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:41,500
so I want money, women, status, fame, and everything else in this world!

201
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,840
And I want eternal life!

202
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,660
But aren't you already immortal?

203
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,550
I was made pretty durable,

204
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,060
so I've been alive for almost two hundred years.

205
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,460
But I'm not quite immortal.

206
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,960
Now, I've told you my secret.

207
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,850
It's your turn.

208
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,270
Tell me the secret to that body.

209
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,280
You should spill it.

210
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,490
You don't want to be taken apart and dissected, do you?

211
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,560
It's impossible.

212
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,240
I don't have any memories of when I became like this,

213
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,340
and I'm not the one who performed the transmutation.

214
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,180
I don't know anything.

215
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,000
Then what about the guy who did it?

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,680
We can ask him.

217
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,700
That's...

218
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,050
Where the heck did Al disappear to?

219
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,560
I don't mind telling ya.

220
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,840
If you tell us his secret, that is.

221
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,180
Brother!

222
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,600
I would never have expected you to get kidnapped.

223
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,020
Brother, this guy's a homunculus!

224
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,030
Homunculus?

225
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,410
Hey, don't go blowing my secret!

226
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,350
So he might have a hint on how to get our bodies back!

227
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,710
Tattoo of Ouroboros.

228
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,910
That's how it is.

229
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,340
It would have been easier if we could have just settled things with the armor boy.

230
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,640
If you're buddies with them,
why don't you just ask them yourself?

231
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,470
"Them"?

232
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,670
There were people with that tattoo at Research Laboratory 5.

233
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,950
And there, I met a guy who had
his soul affixed to a piece of armor.

234
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,820
Seriously?

235
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,200
Well, for certain reasons,

236
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,250
I can't really do that.

237
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,470
So let's discuss this.

238
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,990
You two want to get your bodies back, right?

239
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,330
I'll teach you how to create a homunculus.

240
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,960
And in exchange, you teach me how to transmute a soul.

241
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,670
It's called equivalent exchange.

242
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,120
But seriously...

243
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,430
Is there even a need to get your body back?

244
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,340
Personally, I think that body can be somewhat useful.

245
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,350
No, it's not!

246
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,690
You think so?

247
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,850
You don't get hungry,
you don't get sleepy, you don't get tired.

248
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,860
Sounds awesome to me!

249
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,990
Cut... The...

250
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,740
...Shit!!!

251
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,450
Useful?! Awesome?!

252
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,750
You don't know anything,
and yet you're spewing all this bullshit?!

253
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,710
How to transmute a soul?!

254
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,040
You're not getting an ounce of it from me!!!

255
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,520
If you're a villain, I'll beat you up, smack you,
punch the information out of you and snatch it!!

256
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,220
In other words, I get all and you get nothing!

257
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:46,830
There's no need for equivalent exchange when dealing with a villain!!!

258
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,240
Guess we have to use force again.

259
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,780
Don't kill him.

260
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,280
Fine, fine.

261
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,580
I met a guy on death row who was a lot faster than you!

262
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,630
Next.

263
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,850
Loa, take the armor boy with you.

264
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,490
We'll take him apart and dissect him.

265
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,090
Roger.

266
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,800
H-Hey!

267
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,590
Wait!

268
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,060
Useless.

269
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,570
With a steel sword like that, you can't even add a scratch to this ultimate shield!

270
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,890
Your head's wide open!

271
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,920
Oww... that hurt.

272
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,670
If I was an ordinary human,
I'd need to go to the hospital for this.

273
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,710
Yeah, but you're not really ordinary at all.

274
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,880
Well, my body is normal,

275
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,390
but I've got a little bit of regeneration, and I have the ultimate shield.

276
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,620
Get it now?

277
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,220
You can't beat me.

278
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,890
It'd be smarter to just make the trade.

279
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,140
Oh, you're one of those people, aren't you?

280
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,890
You don't care if you get covered in wounds,

281
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,010
but if your relatives get hurt,
you can't take it and lose your cool.

282
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,220
How foolish.

283
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,910
You're going to let your strong feelings take over like that and lose important information and your brother?

284
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,750
I'll go get my brother back after I beat your ass.

285
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,580
Your regeneration ability isn't endless, right?

286
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,790
As long as I keep hitting the part of you that's flesh, then...

287
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,100
My bad, sorry for going easy on you.

288
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,300
This turns me into an ugly guy,
so I don't really like to show people.

289
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,500
Didn't I say so?

290
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,500
You won't even be able to scratch me.

291
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,690
I found this in the back alley of West Street.

292
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,250
Al disappeared... and now Ed, too.

293
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:01,410
Those idiots! I may even have to make them students again and teach them about taking care of personal belongings!

294
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,120
I've got it!

295
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:07,780
I heard someone who looks like Ed went into a bar called Devil's Nest.

296
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,490
You dead?

297
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,350
Good! Kids should be lively.

298
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,940
No matter how many times you try, you can't win.

299
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,740
How about you tell me the secret now?

300
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,320
Thanks for that.

301
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,620
The blood that was all up in my head went away, and I can think clearly now.

302
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,610
That's my mechanic for ya.

303
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,090
It still moves after all this.

304
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,240
You're still going to resist?

305
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,330
Let this put you to sleep!

306
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,610
I'm solid, aren't I?

307
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,740
That's weird...

308
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,120
So what?!

309
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,250
What, don't you have anything else?!

310
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,760
What the hell... did you do to my shield....

311
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,350
It's simple if you think about it.

312
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:53,230
You said you're a homunculus, but if your body is normal, that means a third of your body is made up of carbon.

313
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,730
Depending on how the carbon atoms are combined, the toughness can range from a pencil tip's to a diamond's.

314
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,520
If you know that much, then it's all a matter of alchemy.

315
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,820
Good!

316
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,660
Otherwise, it wouldn't be fun!

317
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,610
And now, I just figured something out!

318
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,710
You can't harden and regenerate at the same time!

319
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,240
My first impression of you was that of a reckless idiot.

320
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,640
But how many more times can you attack me with that body?

321
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,090
Hi, coming in.

322
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,530
M-Master!

323
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,150
You dumbass!!!

324
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,350
You don't even care enough to put away a single broomstick?!

325
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,990
I-I'm sorry!

326
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,950
Looks like you gave my boys quite a bit of trouble.

327
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,510
Master! He's...

328
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,960
I know.

329
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,380
I could hear you all the way from the hallway.

330
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,290
Come on, give me a break.

331
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,580
I don't really like fighting women-

332
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,560
What... the hell are you?!

333
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,060
A passing...

334
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,050
...housewife!!!

335
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:05,880
Those who are strong are destined to yield to ones who are far stronger.

336
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,330
But their souls will not lose as long as they have pride.

337
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,720
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

338
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Episode 14, Those Who Lurk Underground.

339
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,770
There's more than meets the eye.
