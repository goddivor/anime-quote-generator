1
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,990
The Ice Alchemist?

2
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,490
Yes. He has infiltrated Central.

3
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,070
I'd like you to take command of his capture, Col. Roy Mustang.

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,500
Yes, sir.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,220
I'm thankful you were in Central at this time.

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,930
I can leave this to you without reservation.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,980
Oh, and that boy is here as well.

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,100
Utilize him to your liking.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,600
FÃ¼hrer President Bradley, by "boy", do you mean...

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,270
Yes. The Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric.

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,310
Geez, that Colonel is a slave driver.

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,570
And we'd just bought a train ticket to Lior, too. Guess we're going to have to cancel that.

13
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,010
Well, nothing we can do.

14
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,360
Let's get this over with quick, Al.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,820
All right, Brother.

16
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,250
There he is! That way!

17
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,800
Stop! If you don't...

18
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,280
Freezing and boiling. The elements of water.

19
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,290
Alchemy...

20
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,890
That's pretty horrible.

21
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,950
Sacrifices are inherent when attempting something great.

22
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,120
It's called the exchange of equivalences.

23
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,790
This and that aren't  the same thing!

24
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,300
Without a transmutation circle?!

25
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,380
You've got no time to be gawking!

26
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,040
What?!

27
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,320
There's no way!

28
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,820
It should have boiled if there was a drop of liquid in it!

29
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,970
You ruined my coat.

30
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,370
Auto-mail...

31
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,280
Genius alchemy skills that don't require transmutation circles...

32
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,500
...and an auto-mail as his right arm.

33
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,010
So you're...

34
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,190
...that Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric!

35
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,830
Wait... that's not you?

36
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,290
Umm... well...

37
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,770
I'm Alphonse, his younger brother.

38
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,150
So this runt is...

39
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,770
Who are you calling short?!

40
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,850
To think that someone with the title of "Fullmetal Alchemist"...

41
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,950
...would be such a small child...

42
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,120
Quit calling me short!!!

43
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,990
Brother, I don't think he was talking about your height.

44
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,540
Even so, I can't forgive him!

45
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,050
As expected from Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist.

46
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,050
We appreciate your support.

47
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,280
Oh no, I'm his little brother, Alphonse Elric.

48
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,340
Sorry to make you wait, Al.

49
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,580
Let's go.

50
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Geez, you're in such a rush...

51
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,470
Steam...

52
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,030
Brother, he's...

53
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,000
Damn him, using petty tricks!

54
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,410
Looks like you underestimated your opponent, Fullmetal.

55
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,190
Who the hell is he?

56
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,220
That's why I told you to listen up earlier.

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,510
But you claimed that you would be able to-

58
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,050
Yeah, yeah, I get it. My mistake.

59
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,250
You should always listen to your seniors.

60
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,520
Yeah, yeah.

61
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,790
In any case...

62
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,280
His name is Isaac McDougal.

63
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,460
He used to be a State Alchemist and was called Isaac of the Ice.

64
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,620
Used to?

65
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,610
That's right.

66
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,540
He performed outstandingly during
the Ishbal War as a member of our army.

67
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:02,740
He gave up his title of State Alchemist after the war and became involved in a dissident movement.

68
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,760
Capturing him is a top priority.

69
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,660
But if circumstances dictate it, we may have to kill him.

70
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,540
I'm not going to kill.

71
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,900
Do as you wish.

72
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,260
All we really want are results.

73
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,270
By the way,

74
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,470
have you found any clues on how to fix your body?

75
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,490
Like you'd give us time for that!

76
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,320
Yo, Roy.

77
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,770
What a rough order, capturing the Ice Alchemist, eh?

78
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,520
Or could this be a chance for a promotion?

79
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,900
Whoa! Are you two perhaps... the Elric Brothers?

80
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,500
Oh man, I'm quite honored to be able to meet the youngest State Alchemist.

81
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm Maes Hughes, a Lieutenant Colonel.

82
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,360
U-Umm... I'm Alphonse Elric, the younger brother.

83
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,820
What?! That  one is the Fullmetal Alchemist?!

84
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,270
You'd better not call me a shrimp...

85
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,330
Hughes.

86
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,180
Yo.

87
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,340
If you don't have anything to do here, go home already.

88
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,680
I will, after I do what I need to.

89
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,610
You guys probably haven't booked a place to stay yet, right?

90
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,550
If so, stay at my place.

91
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,460
It's my wife, Gracia, and my daughter, Elicia.

92
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,090
Elicia-chan~

93
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,730
Ow, Daddy! Your beard hurts!

94
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,490
Oh really?

95
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,000
Rub-rub-rub.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,090
Nooo!

97
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,180
Say hi to our guests, the Elric Brothers.

98
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,350
So tall!

99
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,320
So short!

100
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,010
Elicia-chan, I'm Edward Elric.

101
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,830
This is my little brother, Alphonse Elric.

102
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,950
Understand? Little brother.

103
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,330
If you're the older one, how come you're so short?

104
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,330
Now, now, they're letting us stay. Calm down.

105
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,240
Lemme go! Lemme go, Al!

106
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,440
Let's start dinner. Gracia is a great cook.

107
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,240
Whoa!

108
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,460
Come on, eat up.

109
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,900
Itadakimasu!

110
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,550
It's so good! Wow, it tastes great!

111
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,000
Eat a lot, okay?

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,660
Okay!

113
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,390
Oh, Alphonse, you can't eat with that armor on, can you?

114
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,750
O-Oh, this is...

115
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,770
Al is... in the middle of an alchemy training right now!

116
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,060
All right, Al. I'll eat for the both of us like always, okay?

117
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,530
Leave it to me, leave it to me!

118
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,530
Training~ Training~

119
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,710
That's the funniest joke I've heard in a while.

120
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,250
Join forces with the Ice Alchemist?

121
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,260
Me, the Crimson Alchemist?

122
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:58,880
Kimbley, let's defeat Bradley
and the corrupt military, together.

123
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,780
I know you've seen it at Ishbal, too. That hell.

124
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,870
You know what Bradley made us do.

125
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,320
That's why you killed those officers, is it not?

126
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,400
Oh no, please don't misunderstand me.

127
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,760
I wasn't thinking of anything lofty like you are.

128
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,330
The reason I killed them...

129
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,330
...is because I wanted to. That's it.

130
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,690
It's a shame, Kimbley.

131
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,350
It really is.

132
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,260
Thanks.

133
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,780
This is rare. You can't sleep?

134
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,890
Yeah.

135
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,740
Should I take a guess?

136
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,720
You were thinking about those two, weren't you?

137
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,820
State Alchemists are called
the "dogs of the military" by the public.

138
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,580
When I think that he has to carry such a burden at such an age...

139
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,270
Brother, are you awake?

140
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,200
Gracia-san's quiche was just like Mom's, don't you think?

141
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,010
Yeah, it tasted great.

142
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,760
Really?

143
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,890
Then I'd better add that to my
"List of things to eat when I get my body back".

144
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,400
Yeah, you'd better do that!

145
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,220
Brother?

146
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,230
Hmm?

147
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,680
It would be nice to get our bodies back to normal soon, wouldn't it?

148
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,010
Yeah.

149
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,080
Just one more...

150
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,570
With just one more, Bradley will fall straight to hell.

151
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,880
Fullmetal Alchemist.

152
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,360
Fullmetal Alchemist.

153
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,350
According to reports, Isaac infiltrated Central Prison last night.

154
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,140
We cannot let the situation continue any longer. Make sure you seek him out.

155
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,100
Block the roads and search everywhere.

156
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,970
You are authorized to shoot him on sight for all I care.

157
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,210
This is an order from the FÃ¼hrer President!

158
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,360
I... will be heading out, as well!

159
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,260
Hurry, relief soldiers!

160
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,370
Five casualties so far. Report to headquarters!

161
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,760
This is horrible...

162
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,610
It was a steam explosion...

163
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,450
If the temperature of water is raised rapidly, it expands explosively.

164
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,080
A human body is 70% water, after all.

165
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,550
Let's hurry. We have to find that guy fast.

166
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,300
Yeah.

167
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,920
There.

168
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,650
To dodge my alchemy... As expected of you, Sir Isaac.

169
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,850
That voice... Armstrong!

170
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,690
Precisely!

171
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,270
The Strong Arm Alchemist,

172
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,700
Alex Louis Armstrong!

173
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,620
Take this!

174
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,430
High-pressure water slashes through a variety of things!

175
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:17,460
It's quite meaningless against my fist, though!

176
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,000
Major!

177
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,020
Watch out!

178
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,970
Water from a canteen, eh?

179
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,410
Thanks, Al.

180
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,880
We've got to go after him, Brother.

181
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,980
Let's go, Elric Brothers!

182
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,780
Yes!

183
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,780
Right!

184
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,240
It's been a while, Ice.

185
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,450
Roy Mustang...

186
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,440
...no, the Flame Alchemist.

187
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,300
It's a shame that I must fight a past comrade.

188
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,740
Comrade? I do not have any friends.

189
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,550
The only ones that were at Ishbal were the corrupted army and their dogs!

190
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,770
It's just fire, after all.

191
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,230
It can't win against water!

192
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,740
Dammit!

193
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,500
Good, good...

194
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
That's it for you!

195
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,500
I was wondering what the heck you were doing in an alley like this back then...

196
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,710
...so I came back, and bingo.

197
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,510
No use trying to run away.

198
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,150
Run? There's no need for that.

199
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,610
A simultaneous alchemy reaction... like this?

200
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,070
No way...

201
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,570
Don't tell me... could this be...

202
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,070
The Philosopher's Stone!

203
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,960
What?!

204
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,420
It's freezing all of the moisture in the atmosphere...

205
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,790
Edward Elric.

206
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,470
Dog of the military. State Alchemist!

207
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,420
Do you have any idea what this country is trying to do?!

208
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,970
Hell if I know! More importantly...

209
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,970
If you did  know, you'd understand why I'm doing this!

210
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,970
I told you, I don't know!

211
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,760
All right, Al, good work!

212
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,850
Brother, his alchemy...

213
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,570
Yeah!

214
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,570
Hey, you!

215
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,860
You have the philosopher's stone, don't you?!

216
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,870
What are you talking about?

217
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,120
If you're not going to tell me, then I'll make you!

218
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,620
Is this really the time to be blabbering nonsense?!

219
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,140
A skill that has been passed down
the Armstrong household for generations...

220
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,140
We're leaving it to you, Major!

221
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,060
Artistic Alchemy!

222
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,640
Engrave it on your soul!!

223
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,860
What?!

224
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,800
What the hell are you doing, Major?!

225
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,170
No, I...

226
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,220
The wall of ice...

227
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,730
...is connecting....

228
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,370
Could it be... that man...

229
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,370
...is trying to freeze Central...

230
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,290
...no, Central Headquarters?!

231
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,770
Major! Al and I will stop that guy.

232
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,770
While we're on that, please take care of the transmutation circles!

233
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,140
I need to destroy them, right? Got it!

234
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,540
King Bradley! Now is finally the time for me to to send you to hell with my ice!

235
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,560
Now wait just a second!

236
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,790
Out of the way!

237
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,250
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

238
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,710
Brother!

239
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,170
Too slow!

240
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,430
Al!

241
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,350
An... empty armor?!

242
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,060
You... established a soul on to a piece of armor?!

243
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,750
Losing an arm...

244
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,890
...and the little brother is left without a body...

245
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,160
I get it now. You guys...

246
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,960
...committed taboo, didn't you!

247
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,420
The greatest taboo an alchemist can commit...

248
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,920
Human Transmutation!!!

249
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,220
Al!!! Alphonse!!!

250
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,970
Shit! This isn't how it was supposed to be!

251
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:25,060
Dammit!!! They took it away!!!

252
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,360
Give him back... He's my little brother...

253
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,820
Give him back... He's my only brother!!

254
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,040
You... just took a step toward hell.

255
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,490
Just give up!

256
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,500
There's no water for you to use.

257
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,090
You've forgotten...

258
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,250
...what 70% of the human body is made of!

259
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,730
Brother!

260
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,280
You guys don't know the true face of this country!

261
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,990
Brother... Brother!

262
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,660
Al, we're going after him.

263
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,680
Using little tricks like these...

264
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,850
Did we do it?

265
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,930
Again?!

266
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,240
Don't you dare underestimate my flames!

267
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,740
Seriously...

268
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,740
Keep your useless days to rainy days only, please.

269
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,830
Bradley!

270
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,080
Brace yourself!

271
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,970
Too bad for you.

272
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,600
Major! Now!

273
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,480
Roger that!

274
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,460
FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley...

275
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,370
Ah, good work, Fullmetal Alchemist.

276
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:50,220
I now have something to brag to my son about, that I was able to lend you a helping hand.

277
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,950
What, you've caught a cold?

278
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,180
Anyway, I heard you were great out there!

279
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,380
All I did was destroy the transmutation circles.

280
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,080
The FÃ¼hrer President defeated him.

281
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,490
And the FÃ¼hrer President is saying that it was your work.

282
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,890
What, are you unsatisfied?

283
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,000
Accept his words thankfully.

284
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,460
You've always said this, haven't you?

285
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,640
"You should always listen to your seniors."

286
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:26,100
In the end, we never found out whether he had a philosopher's stone or not.

287
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,120
Yeah, we're going to have to wait for the investigation by the army.

288
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,680
Edward Elric, I heard you were hospitalized, and...

289
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,770
...I came here right away!

290
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,020
Now, how about I comfort you while you're bored out of your mind from being hospitalized!

291
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,210
Don't they just bring warmth to your heart? These graceful muscles of mine.

292
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,350
Don't be shy, now. You can touch them.

293
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,020
Stop it!!!

294
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,660
I see. So Isaac died.

295
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,830
He was a human pillar, too. That's too bad.

296
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,020
And? What about the philosopher's stone?

297
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,780
Oh, so he used it all up.

298
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,310
Gluttony, you're not supposed to be eating weird things.

299
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,560
Yeah, it's all going well in Lior.

300
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,020
It will begin soon.

301
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,990
Very soon.

302
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,980
Resembul.

303
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,540
The kind town where the boys were born and spent their childhood with their mother.

304
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,420
Seeking for that smile that was lost,

305
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,330
the boys commit taboo and witness the "truth".

306
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,770
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

307
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,060
Episode 2, The Day It Began.

308
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,860
It was his heart that decided to step out into the world.
