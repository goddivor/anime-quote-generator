1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,110
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,690
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,840
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,250
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,900
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,610
One must not commit this act.

7
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:08,100
The First Branch of the National Central Library, where Marcoh's research data was kept, was burned down.

8
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:15,820
Ed and Al obtain the research data with the help of Sheska, a former librarian. However...

9
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,280
The ingredients of philosopher's stones...

10
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,110
...are live humans.

11
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,900
Seeking more of the truth, Ed and Al sneak into the abandoned Research Laboratory 5.

12
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,990
You're pretty fast for a guy so big.

13
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,250
Else it wouldn't be fun for me!

14
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,430
Who are you?!

15
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,110
I'm Number 66.

16
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,060
That's just my work name, though.

17
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,490
I'll dismantle you neatly,

18
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,780
so go ahead and wail!

19
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,060
What the heck is this?

20
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,150
Could it be what's used to transmute philosopher's stones?

21
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,630
Precisely.

22
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,440
I don't know who you are, but I'm amazed you figured
that out by just looking at the transmutation circle, boy.

23
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,720
Who are you, old man?

24
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,850
My duty is to guard this area.

25
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,610
I suppose I'll introduce myself as Number 48.

26
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,030
And I'm not an old man, either.

27
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,240
I've been instructed to eliminate any outsiders who have infiltrated the building.

28
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,350
Don't think badly of me, boy.

29
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,660
Same goes for you...

30
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,910
Don't take it too badly when you get beaten by a boy.

31
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,740
An alchemist, huh?

32
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,590
Let's see how good you are.

33
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,930
Looks like that arm saved your life!

34
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,270
But my beloved sword even slices through steel!

35
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

36
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,360
Do you not have a body in there?

37
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,060
I'm amazed you noticed.

38
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,450
I spar with someone like you all the time.

39
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,060
Ah, so there's someone in this state in the outside world, too, eh?

40
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't like this at all.

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,840
That there's some idiot other than me who'd come up with the idea of affixing a soul to a suit of armor.

42
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,600
Let me introduce myself again.

43
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,860
48 was my death row number.

44
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:59,360
When I still had my body, I was called Slicer the Homicide.

45
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,110
Death row. Just as I thought.

46
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:08,330
Hey, this place makes philosopher's stones out of criminals on death row, right?

47
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,410
That I cannot answer.

48
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:17,000
I was simply hired for my skills, given this body,
and stationed here as a watchdog.

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,210
Which means there's a seal somewhere that mediates the soul and the armor.

50
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,150
Precisely.

51
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,540
This seal of blood...

52
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,680
If you destroy it, you win.

53
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,620
You're awfully kind to let me in on your weakness.

54
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm the type that seeks thrills in fighting.

55
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,070
Since you're so kind, want to let me off the hook?

56
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,280
Was that worth a try?

57
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,370
Do you really think a murderer is just going to let his prey get away?

58
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,550
Here I come!

59
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,500
Like~I~said~

60
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,750
Elicia's having her third birthday!

61
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,710
Lt. Colonel Hughes, I'm working right now.

62
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,710
East City
Eastern Headquarters

63
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,720
What a coincidence! So am I.

64
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,220
But seriously, she's so cute.

65
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,460
I get it! Quit calling me about your daughter all the time.

66
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,320
And with an army line, too!

67
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,850
Not just my daughter.

68
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,100
I'm proud of my wife, too!

69
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,730
All right, all right, I'll listen to your story, too.

70
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,110
About your cute and charming "Scar" you're so proud of.

71
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,380
We've found several unidentified bodies.

72
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,370
They're pretty decomposed, so it's
difficult to determine if he's in there.

73
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,080
There haven't been any sightings of him in the East,
so as of now, most people believe he's dead.

74
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,550
If that's the case, we can probably set
the Elric brothers free of their escorts soon.

75
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,010
Is Major Armstrong still in charge of that?

76
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,600
Nah, apparently the Major's subordinates have taken over.

77
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,810
They got us!

78
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,590
I knew they were being too quiet...

79
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,190
Major Armstrong's going to kill us for dereliction of duty!

80
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,860
Those brats! They should put themselves in their escorts' shoes every once in a while!

81
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,510
Let's go!

82
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,830
Huh? Where?

83
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,310
Where do you think?

84
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,250
The former Research Laboratory 5!

85
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,970
Huh? Something doesn't feel right in my shoulder...

86
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,020
...this time so it would be more resistant to rust,
but that makes it less durable, so don't overuse...

87
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,850
If I don't settle this quick...

88
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,190
...I'm in trouble!

89
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,220
You're almost like a monkey.

90
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,130
What'd you say?!

91
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,220
I haven't had worthy prey like you in a while. I'm delighted.

92
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,190
But with your wounds and fatigue, the outcome is clear.

93
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,390
My companion should have disposed of your companion by now.

94
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,860
Is your companion strong?

95
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,610
He is. Weaker than me, though.

96
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,020
No worries there, then.

97
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,630
I've been in a lot of fights with him
since we were little, and I've never won.

98
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,940
Dammit, stay still and let me cut you, hippo!

99
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,950
That body...

100
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
I've got a few circumstances of my own.

101
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,260
Actually, let me tell you a story.

102
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,450
You've heard of him, too, haven't you?

103
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,830
A middle-aged man by the name of Barry.

104
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:40,130
A long, long time ago, there was a middle-aged man here in Central named Barry who loved to cook.

105
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,970
Barry loved to cut up meat.

106
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,560
But one day, it got to the point he couldn't satisfy himself with just beef and pork,

107
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,360
so he started to go out into the city during nighttime to cut up humans.

108
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:02,490
Barry was eventually caught, but the number of people who fell victim to him was twenty-three.

109
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:09,800
After terrorizing the hell out of the residents of Central, he was sentenced to death by hanging.

110
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,910
And everyone lived happily ever after...

111
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,020
...is the story given to the public.

112
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,630
But there's actually a sequel to the story.

113
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,580
Barry isn't actually dead.

114
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,420
He's alive and has been assigned to watch over a certain somewhere.

115
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,180
Though he's had his body taken away.

116
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:38,820
That's right! The man standing in front of you right now is the infamous serial killer, Barry the Chopper!

117
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,150
Sorry, I've never heard of you.

118
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,370
I was born in the countryside in the East, so...

119
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,040
Yeah, but even if you've never heard the story, shouldn't you give some kind of reaction?!

120
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,870
Something like...

121
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,900
"AHHHH!", or "What's with that body?!"

122
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,620
AHHHH! W-W-W-What's with that body?!

123
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,920
That hurt, you know.

124
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,060
Oh, so you were sentenced to death, too.

125
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,150
Scaring me like that...

126
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,200
I'm not a criminal!

127
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,890
Huh? Then why?

128
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,690
Well... I've had a few circumstances of my own.

129
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,410
My older brother affixed my soul when I lost my body.

130
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,500
Brother?

131
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,440
I see. Your brother, eh?

132
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,370
What's so funny?

133
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,820
Are you guys really brothers?

134
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,350
I mean, our personalities are different, but...

135
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,580
Oh. No, no, no, that's not what I meant.

136
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,590
What I meant to say was, maybe you're
an armor doll your "brother" created?

137
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,560
Huh?

138
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,300
Does your real human self really exist?

139
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,530
Of course it does!

140
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm Alphonse Elric, a human! No doubt about it!

141
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,100
How can you be so sure?

142
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,730
Because I have memories from when I was born!

143
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,100
What if those were created, too?

144
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,270
But Winry and Granny...

145
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,530
They're probably in on it, too.

146
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,690
Yeah, that's how it is.

147
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,200
You didn't exist to begin with.

148
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,830
T-Then... what about you?

149
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,760
It's simple.

150
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,520
Don't move! This place is restric-

151
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,560
See?

152
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,940
I love hacking live humans!

153
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,130
I love to kill, and I can't get enough of it!

154
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,940
I exist to kill.

155
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,740
That's the only proof I need to know that I am who I am!

156
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,330
So your little brother is that strong, eh?

157
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,170
Then I had better defeat you quickly.

158
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,310
Al, now!

159
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,030
What?!

160
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,720
How foul!

161
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,500
Like there are rules in a fight!

162
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,470
What's wrong? My blood seal isn't broken yet.

163
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,230
Just hurry up and dest-

164
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,400
There's something I want to ask you.

165
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,040
About the philosopher's stone?

166
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,980
Spill everything you know.

167
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,850
No can do.

168
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,940
Hey now, the loser shouldn't be putting on a brave front.

169
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,190
I... haven't lost yet.

170
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,640
Impossible!

171
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,410
I forgot to mention it. Slicer the Homicide...

172
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,050
...Was actually a duo of brothers.

173
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,570
The head and body are two different people?!

174
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,050
That's cheating.

175
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,260
And who's the one who said there aren't any rules in a fight?

176
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,390
Let's go for Round 2, runt.

177
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,780
Don't call me a runt!

178
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,310
Whoa, I'm not going to give you time for a transmutation!

179
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,000
Shit, I lost too much blood.

180
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,400
I'm starting to feel dizzy...

181
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,450
This is bad...

182
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,200
Bad...

183
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,620
I'm...

184
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,210
I'm going to die!

185
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,770
This is it for you!

186
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,060
Ouch...

187
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,160
Making me remember that jerk.

188
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,690
I just did the same thing he did.

189
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,050
You've gone and done it now, brat!

190
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,770
Man, that's disgusting!

191
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,900
Brother!

192
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,400
It's shameful, but we lost.

193
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,750
You're not going to say something like, "Hey, we're actually a trio", are ya?

194
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,740
We won't, we won't.

195
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,320
Just destroy us already, boy.

196
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,260
Spare me from having to murder someone.

197
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,830
You consider us human?

198
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:11,380
If I didn't accept you two as human,
it would mean I'm doing the same to my brother, too.

199
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,360
Hey now, what's wrong, armor doll?!

200
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,710
I'm not an armor doll!

201
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,560
That's what you think.

202
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,080
Did you really exist to begin with?

203
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,440
Are you sure about that?

204
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,030
There's a way to prove you're not an armor doll.

205
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,820
You've got a blood seal, too, don't you?

206
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,330
Erase it yourself.

207
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,410
If you die, you were human!

208
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,330
If you're still movin', then you're an armor doll!

209
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,870
I-I can't do something like that!

210
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,460
Then I'll do it for you!

211
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,150
My little brother is human.

212
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,090
So are you two.

213
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,080
That's why I don't want to kill you.

214
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,140
Brother?

215
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,800
Us two have been stealing, destroying,
and murdering ever since we came of age.

216
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,310
And we're being treated as humans for the first time, after being turned into this?

217
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,920
Interesting.

218
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,530
I'll tell you everything as a parting gift, boy.

219
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,870
The one who created the philosopher's stone and told us to guard this place is...

220
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,590
That was close.

221
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,280
You can't be talking about things like that, 48.

222
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,480
Huh? What's the Fullmetal runt doing here?

223
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,680
What a troublesome child.

224
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,980
How did you find out about this place?

225
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,860
Brother! Brother?!

226
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,610
BROTHER!!!

227
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,990
You're so annoying, dumbass!

228
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,280
You guys were about to kill a precious sacrifice!

229
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,580
Don't you understand?!

230
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,630
What were you gonna do if you screwed up the plan?!

231
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,920
Huh?!

232
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,320
Who the hell are you two?!

233
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,280
What plan?!

234
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,990
What do you mean by sacrifice?!

235
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,110
Oh? This runt is ready to go.

236
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,370
Quit calling me a runt!

237
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,350
A runt's a runt, don't you agree?

238
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,200
I don't like fighting.

239
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,790
It hurts if you get injured.

240
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,050
You're the one that started it!

241
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,090
I'll beat you to a...

242
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,470
Looks like it's broken.

243
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,970
WHAT?!

244
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,760
Lucky me!

245
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,380
Good thing your arm broke.

246
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,560
You didn't have to suffer any other injuries.

247
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,500
Listen, boy.

248
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,310
Don't forget you're being kept alive.

249
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,830
It'll be troublesome if a boy like this
happens to find this place again.

250
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,910
Let's burn it down.

251
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,750
Hey... there's something I've always wanted to ask you...

252
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,870
...but I've been too scared to.

253
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,650
What was Brother trying to say?

254
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,090
"Something he was too scared to say?"

255
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,740
Something he was too scared to...

256
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,970
...maybe you're an armor doll your "brother" created?

257
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,430
Does your real human self really exist?

258
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,570
What's wrong, armor dollie?

259
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,560
Shut up!! I'm...

260
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,030
Just accept it. It'll make you feel better.

261
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,950
You're full of openings, hippo!

262
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,490
Huh?!

263
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,580
Don't move!

264
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,130
Just surrender.

265
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,670
This isn't good...

266
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,940
Sergeant... evacuate!

267
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,640
What are you doing?!

268
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,870
Hurry and get out of here!

269
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,080
But Brother's still inside!

270
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,530
What did you say?!

271
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,580
Well, this leaves me no choice.

272
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,490
I guess I'll just get out of here!

273
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,660
Hey!

274
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,390
You guys better run, too!

275
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,870
Wait!

276
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,790
Brother! Brother!

277
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,660
Get out of here!

278
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,510
You'll get caught in it, too!

279
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,290
But!

280
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,120
Howdy.

281
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,200
A package for you.

282
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,550
Brother?!

283
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,770
He isn't in danger or anything, but he lost a lot of blood, so get him to a hospital quick, okay?

284
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,850
Oh yeah, and make sure you guys keep an eye on him so he doesn't do anything too reckless.

285
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,180
He's an important guy, after all.

286
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,280
And who are you?

287
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,200
Second Lt. Ross, hurry!

288
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,040
Sergeant, lend me a hand!

289
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,090
He's covered in blood!

290
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,650
We'll talk later! You'd better get out of here, too-

291
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,320
Huh? He's gone.

292
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,510
Let us out!

293
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,010
You plannin' on lettin' us die?!

294
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,270
Shut up! Pipe down!

295
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,430
What a nice sound.

296
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,150
This is the sound of a building crumbling due to explosives.

297
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,290
Judging from the proximity... it's probably Research Laboratory 5 next door.

298
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,020
Ah, what a nice sound...

299
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,420
It shakes me to my bones.

300
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,740
Shut your trap, Kimbley!

301
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,790
Ah, I apologize.

302
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:18,000
It reminded me of the Ishbal Extermination, and it just made me so happy...

303
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,770
...maybe you're an armor doll your "brother" created?

304
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,860
And so, about Central...

305
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,660
The bigwigs who oversee State Alchemists are going through a labor shortage thanks to Scar.

306
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,000
Oh?

307
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,350
Rumor is it won't be long before
Colonel Mustang is invited to Central.

308
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,780
Central, huh?

309
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,360
Not bad.

310
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,000
You'd better watch out.

311
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,150
If you manage to get to the top at that age,
you'll gain a lot of enemies.

312
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,800
I'm prepared for it.

313
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,640
Words of wisdom from your senior in Central.

314
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,190
Have a lot of people who understand and are willing to support you.

315
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,400
So...

316
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,650
Hurry up and get married.

317
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,020
None of your business!

318
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,160
Why'd he hang up on me like that?

319
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,720
Lt. Colonel Hughes, please keep personal calls to a minimum!

320
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,230
Oh, sorry.

321
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,460
Edward Elric hesitates to speak his words...

322
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,460
...and Alphonse Elric becomes perplexed by Barry's words.

323
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:12,880
The one certainty is that a girl's memories hold the truth.

324
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,850
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

325
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,850
Episode 9, Artificial Feelings.

326
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:25,780
Their hearts waver because they put their trust in each other.
