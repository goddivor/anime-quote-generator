1
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:40,250
Ed and Al infiltrated the former Research Laboratory 5,
seeking the secret of the philosopher's stones.

2
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,870
There, they encountered people who had their souls affixed to suits of armor.

3
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:58,860
Due to what Number 66 said during their battle, Al started to question whether he was a faux soul, created by Ed.

4
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,560
Looks like you're able to get up now.

5
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,240
What happened to Research Laboratory 5?

6
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,650
About that...

7
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,820
It was blown up by someone and has been completely destroyed...

8
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,650
Dammit!!! It's all gone?!

9
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,030
O-Oww...

10
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,660
D-Dammit...

11
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,360
I was so close to the "truth", too!

12
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,030
I can't be sitting in a hospital like this!

13
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,280
Mr. Fullmetal Alchemist!

14
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,050
We apologize for the rudeness in advance!

15
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,300
Huh?

16
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,870
Doing whatever you wanted...

17
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,350
If things had gone badly, you would have died!

18
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,570
Instead of trying to do everything by yourselves, rely on the people around you!

19
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,780
It wouldn't hurt to trust your elders, don't you think?

20
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,210
That is all!

21
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,830
Please forgive our rude language and violence toward a higher-ranking officer, sir!

22
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,760
N-No...

23
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,840
My fault.

24
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,870
Punishment... for the slap, sir?

25
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,020
No, I wouldn't dream of it!

26
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,430
Why do you guys try to be so considerate around me?

27
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,500
Because being a State Alchemist is equivalent to being a Major in the army.

28
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,450
I didn't get my state qualification for something like that.

29
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,280
You guys don't need to be so polite to me, either.

30
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,690
Oh, really?

31
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,070
Wow, all those times have been a waste, haven't they?

32
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,990
What a quick change!

33
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,100
Oh... now that I think about it, where's Al?

34
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,640
I scolded him with a fist earlier.

35
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,750
Ow...

36
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,970
I forgot about the other person who's going give me a scolding.

37
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,970
Hello? You've reached the Rockbells,
specializing in prosthetics and orthotics.

38
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,100
Ed?

39
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,100
It's rare for you to call.

40
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,900
U-Umm...

41
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,560
This is extremely difficult for me to say, but...

42
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,590
Do you mind taking a trip to Central for a little maintenance?

43
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,730
Trip?

44
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,430
Well...

45
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,280
It's my right arm.

46
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,330
My fingers move, but I can't lift my arm at all.

47
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,560
So it was no good, after all.

48
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,100
Huh?

49
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,830
No, no, it's nothing.

50
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,130
Did you do something before your arm stopped moving?

51
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,470
I-I was in an all-out brawl.

52
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,600
AGAIN?! Quit using my automail for things like that!

53
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,170
H... Hello?

54
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,620
Miss Winry?

55
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,170
I guess there's no choice.

56
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,610
Where in Central?

57
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,720
Hey, you're kind of nice tod-

58
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,650
I mean... Nothing...

59
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,210
Okay. Gotcha.

60
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,540
Sorry for the trouble.

61
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,310
Yeah.

62
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,040
Thanks.

63
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,790
A love call to your girlfriend?

64
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,050
Who's my girlfriend?!

65
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,620
How boring.

66
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,410
When I was your age, I had...

67
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,300
Huh?

68
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,190
What are you doing over there?

69
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,720
Hey, Al!

70
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,370
Brother...

71
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,310
Want to head to our room?

72
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,740
Hm?

73
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,900
No, it's nothing.

74
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,990
I'll meet you there.

75
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,540
Okay.

76
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,220
Bye!

77
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,520
...maybe you're an armor doll that your "brother" created?

78
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,130
Oww, my rear...

79
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,790
I don't see how Ed and Al can ride these things all the time.

80
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,420
He said there'd be someone waiting for me at the
west gate, and I'd be able to spot him right away, but...

81
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,420
Oh.

82
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,630
Major Armstrong!

83
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,360
Ah, Miss Winry!

84
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,100
Where are those stupid Elric brothers?

85
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,640
To tell you the truth...

86
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,690
Ed's in the hospital?!

87
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,450
Th-That was fast.

88
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,020
You're planning on charging me a rush fee, aren't you?

89
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,940
But... you were injured this badly when your automail broke, because I...

90
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,630
...I didn't equip it properly, right?

91
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,130
I-It's not your fault or anything!

92
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:38,150
I'm the one who used it recklessly,
and the maintenance was perfect, as always.

93
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,980
He didn't notice the missing screw?

94
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,770
And there's also the fact I didn't have to get hurt more because my arm broke!

95
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,610
So don't worry about it! Yeah? Yeah?

96
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,990
So it all works out?

97
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,530
Okay, so about this maintenance trip!

98
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,930
On second thought, I'll be charging a rush fee!

99
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,770
Huh?

100
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,540
You didn't drink your milk.

101
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,420
I... don't like milk.

102
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,510
And that's why you're so short!

103
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,580
Shut up!

104
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,930
I can't help that I don't like it!

105
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,560
You're being picky, Edward Elric!

106
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,080
All the kids drink it.

107
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,770
You won't get any girls if you can't drink milk.

108
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,870
Al?

109
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,700
Al's been acting strange lately.

110
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,200
What do you mean by strange?

111
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,200
Seems to me something's on his mind.

112
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,470
...maybe you're an armor doll that your "brother" created?

113
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,230
Just accept it. It'll make you feel better.

114
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,360
There! Maintenance complete!

115
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,530
Awesome!

116
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,940
It's finally fixed.

117
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,630
Thanks a lot.

118
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,050
You're welcome.

119
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,380
Yo, Ed!

120
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,090
So I heard you're kind of occupied after bringing a woman into your room.

121
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,770
She's just my automail mechanic!

122
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,590
Wow... so you sweet-talked your mechanic, huh...

123
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,430
When I say one thing, you come up with another!

124
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,980
I'm Maes Hughes.

125
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,890
Pleasure to meet you.

126
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,110
I'm Winry Rockbell.

127
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,630
Won't you get in trouble for ditching work?

128
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,650
No need to worry!

129
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,990
I left Sheska with overtime work.

130
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,340
What are you, a demon?

131
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,850
Oh yeah, you guys are almost free from your escorts.

132
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,360
Really?!

133
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,620
Escorts?

134
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,520
Hey, you...

135
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,000
Just what kind of dangerous situations are you getting yourself into?!

136
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,920
Well, look. How should I put it...

137
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,450
I-It's not a big deal.

138
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,290
That's right.

139
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,440
You two never tell me anything, anyway.

140
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,270
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

141
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,100
I'm going to go look for a place to stay for the night.

142
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,030
What?!

143
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,320
Then stay at my place!

144
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,550
But...

145
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,080
Don't worry about it!

146
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,880
My wife and daughter will be delighted.

147
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,430
No, but...

148
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,850
All right, it's settled!

149
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,130
Huh?! Wait!

150
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,600
Come on, let's go!

151
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,380
Hang on!!!

152
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,300
Happy birthday Elicia!

153
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,610
U-Umm, Mr. Hughes? What exactly is...

154
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,850
Why, thank you for asking.

155
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,120
Today is Elicia's birthday, so to speak!

156
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,670
So to speak!

157
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,500
So how old are you now, Elicia?

158
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,430
Tw-

159
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,410
Three!

160
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,440
Sh...

161
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,380
She's...

162
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,910
So cute!

163
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,090
I've been with them ever since we were little, so they're kind of like my brothers.

164
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,260
You must always be worried about them with the way they are, aren't you?

165
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,770
You bet!

166
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,560
They came home after such a long time,
and Ed's arm was in pieces.

167
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,570
And when they called me up, Ed's severely injured...

168
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,820
...and Al's being troubled by something...

169
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,250
But they'll never tell me what happened.

170
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,640
Even when they left Resembool...

171
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,960
They probably didn't feel the need to discuss it.

172
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,590
They probably thought that you'd understand, even if they didn't tell you.

173
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,550
But... there are some things in life that will only be understood through words.

174
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,340
I guess that's just the way things are.

175
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,780
Guys always convey things with actions, not words,

176
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,570
so if it's something tough, they don't want others to have to put up with it.

177
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,070
They don't want to worry people, either.

178
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,340
So they don't say it.

179
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,820
But even then, if those brothers happen to whine...

180
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,920
...you comfort them and set them straight.

181
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,360
I think that's perfect.

182
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,200
Elicia, let's play!

183
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,700
I'm getting off!

184
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,140
Here you go.

185
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,040
Hey! Elicia's going to be playing with me!

186
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,190
What? I'm  going to be playing with her!

187
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,880
Your daughter sure is popular.

188
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,890
No!

189
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,650
She's mine!

190
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,250
Hey, you brats!

191
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,690
Do something to my daughter and see what happens!

192
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,450
You don't need to convey things with actions that  much!

193
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,290
Are you sure?

194
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,790
You can stay here for as long as you're in Central, you know.

195
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,340
No, that would be too much trouble...

196
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,310
She's gotten so attached to you.

197
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,300
From this perspective, they almost look like sisters.

198
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,350
Winry!

199
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,850
Have a nice day!

200
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,390
Come home soon, okay?

201
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,390
Looks like it's decided.

202
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,920
It's like I have a little sister now!

203
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,120
So you came again, bastard.

204
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,170
You've got a living body...

205
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,880
...so you have to drink it.

206
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,330
I can't help that I don't like it!

207
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,730
I'm actually growing, despite how I look.

208
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,350
But everyone just calls me puny...

209
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,930
You've got it easy, Al.

210
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,690
Since you're so big already.

211
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,900
I didn't become like this because I wanted to!

212
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,700
M-My bad...

213
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,280
You're right.

214
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,000
It's my fault we became like this, after all.

215
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,650
That's why I want to get your body ba-

216
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,540
Is there really a guarantee
I'll be able to return to my old body?!

217
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,280
I'll make it come true.

218
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,510
Believe in me.

219
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,000
Believe?!

220
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,510
What am I supposed to believe with this empty body?!

221
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,130
Memories are just information if you really think about it!

222
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,850
It should be possible to create them artificially!

223
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,750
What are yo-

224
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,770
Brother, you once told me there was something you couldn't say to me because you were too afraid, right?

225
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,470
Could it be you were trying to say...

226
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:30,780
...that I'm just a fake... an artificial soul and a set of memories you created?!

227
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,810
Winry, you and Granny are both trying to deceive me, aren't you?

228
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,750
Am I right, Brother?!

229
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,760
Are those the thoughts you've been holding in?

230
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,760
Is that all you've got to say?

231
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,670
I see.

232
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,930
Ed...

233
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,830
Ed!

234
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,620
Al, you...

235
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,100
IDIOT!!!

236
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,540
W-What was that for?!

237
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,750
Winry?!

238
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,220
You moron!

239
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,140
You don't even know how Ed feels!

240
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,890
What Ed was afraid to ask you...

241
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,580
...is whether you hate him or not!

242
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,540
It's all... my fault...

243
00:16:53,540 --> 00:17:00,330
He can't even eat, sleep, or feel pain anymore...

244
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,330
He... He hates me for sure...

245
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,580
Al wouldn't.

246
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,330
Why don't you just ask him?

247
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,000
I... I'm scared...

248
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,660
I'm too scared to ask...

249
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,740
And... And yet...

250
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,970
You...

251
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,480
Just who the heck would be prepared to
give up his life just to create a fake brother?

252
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,710
Don't you two only have each other?

253
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,700
Go after him!

254
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,410
Y... Yeah.

255
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,410
MOVE!

256
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,420
Yes, ma'am!

257
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:03,700
Brot-

258
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:09,280
Now that I think about it, I've gotten a bit rusty because we haven't sparred in a while.

259
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,100
Huh?

260
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,610
Wha? Wa-

261
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,370
W-Wait a second, Brother!

262
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,930
Hold on!

263
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,710
Your wounds are going to open back up!

264
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,970
I win!

265
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,940
For the first time in my life, I beat you!

266
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,780
That wasn't fair, Brother.

267
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,440
Sh-Shut up!

268
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,770
A win's a win!

269
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,090
We've always fought a lot, haven't we.

270
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:54,890
Yeah.

271
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,960
Now that I think about it, we fought for the dumbest reasons, didn't we?

272
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,310
Like who gets to sleep in the top bunk.

273
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,030
Yep.

274
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,860
We fought over snacks, too, didn't we?

275
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,670
We also fought over toys.

276
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,020
I won.

277
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,790
Even when we played by Raine River...

278
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,960
You pushed me in, didn't you?

279
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,290
We fought all the time during our training, too, remember?

280
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:20,380
That was a draw since Master nearly beat us both to death for being "annoying".

281
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,700
We also fought over who would marry Winry.

282
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,730
I don't remember that!

283
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,560
I won. But she said no.

284
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,500
I-I see...

285
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,500
Are you going to tell me all that was a lie?

286
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,410
I'm sorry...

287
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,900
We want to return to our bodies, no matter what it takes.

288
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,630
Are you trying to say those feelings are artificial, too?

289
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,660
They're not.

290
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,710
That's right.

291
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,110
We decided to return to our bodies together, for sure.

292
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,380
We're going to be moving forward!

293
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,180
If we move forward, we'll get stronger, both physically and mentally.

294
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,390
What about milk?

295
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,310
I'll drink it!

296
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,430
...as much as possible.

297
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,320
Let's get stronger.

298
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,390
Yeah.

299
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,530
Mr. Hughes.

300
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,110
There are things that can only be conveyed through words. Don't you agree?

301
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,630
You're right.

302
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,460
Brother...

303
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,090
Master...

304
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,680
Where... did everyone...

305
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,090
Hi.

306
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,950
You're not an Ishbalan, are you?

307
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,000
Ah, pardon me.

308
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,100
I haven't introduced myself yet.

309
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:00,610
I'm a State Alchemist who is going to be in charge of destroying this area.

310
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,240
Oh, he's awake.

311
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,690
Where am I?

312
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,040
You're in the slums on the outskirts of East City.

313
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,100
Sir... you are...

314
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,670
I'm Ishbalan, just like yourself.

315
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,640
Don't worry, I won't sell you out or anything.

316
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,640
Are there other Ishbalan survivors in this place?

317
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,090
There sure are.

318
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,370
Even a soot-covered place like this feels like a city if you live here.

319
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:44,650
In other words, "All of this world is within the bosom of our God, Ishvala."

320
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,330
I... see...

321
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,700
Don't push yourself!

322
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,120
You were floating around in the sewers, covered in wounds.

323
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,720
Hey...

324
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,130
Is my right arm still attached?

325
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,630
Yeah, it is.

326
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,560
These tattoos are amazing.

327
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,060
Yeah.

328
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,280
It's a precious bond I received from my family...

329
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:04,250
Your best friend eventually becomes your comrade-in-arms, and finally, an everyday fixture in your life.

330
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:12,760
Even if the future you discussed had turned into a shade of lead, your best friend hadn't changed and was always there.

331
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,890
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

332
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,890
Episode 10, Separate Ways.

333
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:26,020
A fixture in one's life. Something like that cannot be replaced.
