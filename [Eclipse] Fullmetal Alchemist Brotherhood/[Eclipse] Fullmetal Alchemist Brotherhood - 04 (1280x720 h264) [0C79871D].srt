1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,090
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,750
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,250
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,290
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,900
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,640
One must not commit this act.

7
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:08,600
In the city of Lior, a High Priest of Leto deceived people through the use of the Philosopher's Stone and alchemy.

8
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,400
Ed and Al, who ventured into the church, stopped the High Priest's plot.

9
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,490
However, the Philosopher's Stone was a fake.

10
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,580
"Get up and take a step. Walk forward."

11
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,700
Ed's words pierced Rose's chest, who had lost all hope.

12
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,580
But, those words were also meant for themselves, as well.

13
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,610
You're Basque Gran, the "Iron Blood Alchemist", aren't you?

14
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,050
Who are you?

15
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,400
Alchemists who go against God's path...

16
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,400
...shall perish!

17
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,600
So you're the killer who only goes after State Alchemists.

18
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,360
But!

19
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,410
You picked... the wrong opponent!

20
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,210
You're fast! But...

21
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,720
Well, then...

22
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,540
How foolish.

23
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,650
W-What?!

24
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,530
Perish.

25
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,880
Another State Alchemist?

26
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,840
Looks like quite a mess.

27
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,130
You have to be careful, too, Major.

28
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,640
You may be his next target.

29
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,740
Yes, sir...

30
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,910
FÃ¼hrer President!

31
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,110
Why are you here, sir?

32
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,940
I heard the news.

33
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,400
Lt. Colonel Hughes, are you in charge of dealing with this matter?

34
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,090
Yes, sir!

35
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,450
If there are people whom you require assistance from, request them immediately.

36
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,450
We must bring the iron hammer down on the traitors.

37
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,670
Yes, sir!

38
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,460
Second Lieutenant Breda.

39
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,470
All right...

40
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,850
Seriously... The Colonel must have been procrastinating again.

41
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,300
Hey, Havoc, do half of these for me.

42
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,470
I've got my hands full over here, too.

43
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,160
Umm, who is this again?

44
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,500
That's Lieutenant Yoki.

45
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,750
He's a little rascal who was lining his pockets with the authority he was given at the coal mines of Youswell.

46
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,900
He's currently on the run after having
his actions exposed by the Elric Brothers.

47
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,790
Sergeant Fuery, how is the radio?

48
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,720
The receiver is broken.

49
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,310
We'll need to replace some parts...

50
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,160
Edward-kun! Alphonse-kun!

51
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,230
Welcome back, you two.

52
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,930
The Colonel has been waiting for you.

53
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,060
The matter in Lior is settled all thanks to you.

54
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,510
I'd like to express my gratitude.

55
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,190
It wasn't for you or anything.

56
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,780
And, was the search for
the Philosopher's Stone a failure again?

57
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,810
The stone was a fake.

58
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,190
But the power was unbelievable.

59
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,350
He transmuted a huge chimera, too.

60
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,320
I wonder how you could use the stone to make something like that?

61
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,420
I'm not really familiar with the field of
Biological Alchemy, so I wouldn't know, but...

62
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,700
Yeah, I'm a little curious.

63
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,220
If we put our effort into researching it,
we may find something useful in getting our bodies back.

64
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,910
Yeah.

65
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,920
Then, how about seeking help from a specialist?

66
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,740
Huh?

67
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,740
The Sewing-Life Alchemist, Shou Tucker.

68
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,940
He is a scholar in chimera Transmutation.

69
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,050
I'll introduce you to him.

70
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,070
You're going to go out of your way to do that?

71
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,000
I-It's a trap! There's definitely more than meets the eye!

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,800
Don't look at me with those suspicious eyes!

73
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,210
We're even after that case in Lior!

74
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,940
It just feels disgusting to know that I owe you.

75
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:32,700
Tucker became a State Alchemist two years ago after transmuting a chimera that understood human language.

76
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,420
"Understood human language"?

77
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,010
It could speak?! The chimera?!

78
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,460
Yeah. Apparently, it did.

79
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,460
Just one sentence...

80
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,710
"I want to die."

81
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,500
It never ate afterwards and died.

82
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,350
What a huge house.

83
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,680
B-Brother!

84
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,790
Wow, we've got a lot of visitors!

85
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,450
Nina, we have to keep the dog tied down.

86
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,400
I'm terribly sorry.

87
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,040
This house has been in a mess ever since my wife left.

88
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,460
Well, pleasure to meet you, Edward.

89
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,630
I'm Shou Tucker, the Sewing-Life Alchemist.

90
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,260
He is interested in the transmutation of living organisms.

91
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,640
He said he would love to have
the honor of seeing your work.

92
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,780
Sure, that's fine with me.

93
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,020
One thing, though...

94
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,090
If you'd like for me to show you my hand,

95
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,990
I'm going to need to see yours, too.

96
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,950
Isn't that what being an alchemist is about?

97
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,320
Why are you interested in the transmutation of the living organisms, exactly?

98
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,210
Oh, well... he's...

99
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,120
Colonel.

100
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,170
Transmutation of your mother?!

101
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,690
As an eleven year old child?!

102
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,210
Ah, I see. So that's why you're called "The Fullmetal Alchemist"...

103
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,680
You've experienced a tough past, haven't you...

104
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,690
I'm not sure whether I could be of any help at all,

105
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,020
but please take a look at my laboratory.

106
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,880
Wow...

107
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,990
Ah, this is a little embarrassing.

108
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:43,620
People call me the "authority" on chimeras, but in reality, it's not really going very well.

109
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,740
Wow, this is awesome!

110
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,170
That's the reference room. Feel free to take a look around.

111
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,170
All right. Then I'll start with this shelf.

112
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,230
Then I'll start with that one over there.

113
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,610
I'll be returning to work.

114
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,930
I'll send someone to pick them up in the evening.

115
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,510
Wow, he's really into it.

116
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,940
He can't even hear what's going on around him.

117
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,860
I guess geniuses really do exist.

118
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,640
Up high! Up high!

119
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,970
Al, what the heck are you doing?!

120
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,770
Nina seemed like she wanted someone to play with her.

121
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,970
Hey, what the heck do you think we're here for-

122
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,950
Alexander wants someone to play with, too, he says.

123
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,160
You've got some guts.

124
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,420
It's said that even when hunting rabbits, lions put forth their fullest effort.

125
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:14,090
I, Edward Elric, shall deal with you with all of my physical and spiritual might!!!

126
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,450
You damn dog!!!

127
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,050
Yo Boss, I've come to pick you up.

128
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,530
What are you doing?

129
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,520
Eh, just taking a break from research...

130
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,460
Did you manage to get good data?

131
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,360
You're welcome to visit tomorrow, too.

132
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,560
You'll come visit again?

133
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,500
Let's play tomorrow, all right, Nina?

134
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,160
Okay!

135
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,420
Oh right, Mr. Tucker, I've got a message for you from the Colonel.

136
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,440
He told me to tell you, "It's almost the day of the assessment. Don't forget."

137
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,690
Yes, understood.

138
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,090
Well, then.

139
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,160
Daddy.

140
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,700
What's an "assessment"?

141
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,890
Well...

142
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:15,130
A State Alchemist has to report the results of his experiments once a year.

143
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,700
Daddy couldn't get a good evaluation last year.

144
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,260
If Daddy messes up this year,
Daddy won't be a State Alchemist anymore.

145
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,610
What?!

146
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,830
You'll be fine, Daddy!

147
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,150
You're always studying so much!

148
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,590
You're right. I've got to do my best.

149
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,210
This... is my last chance...

150
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,810
Huh, your mother left home two years ago?

151
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,480
Daddy told me that she went back to her parents' home.

152
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,820
Oh... it must be kind of lonely for you,
being alone with your daddy in a big house like this.

153
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,830
Nope, I'm fine.

154
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,760
Daddy's really nice, and I've got Alexander with me, too.

155
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,760
But... Daddy's always at his lab these days, so..

156
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,840
I guess I'm kind of lonely...

157
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,040
Ugh, my shoulders have gotten a little stiff.

158
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,390
Why don't you exercise a bit, Brother?

159
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,630
That sounds kind of nice.

160
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,230
Hey, dog!

161
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,450
Accompany me on my exercises!

162
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,100
You, too, Nina.

163
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,860
Wait up!

164
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,320
Watch this!

165
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,450
Hey, hey, hey!

166
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,120
Wait, you!

167
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,620
Wait!

168
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,930
You can do it, Alexander!

169
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,190
"It's almost the day of the assessment. Don't forget."

170
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,570
But... why does he only target State Alchemists?

171
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,570
If the army is his target, he can just attack soldiers indiscriminately.

172
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,080
Since Alchemists possess special abilities, they're not easy to kill.

173
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,370
And one with a state qualification should be much tougher.

174
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,280
Perhaps it's the qualification that's the reason?

175
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,970
Hm?

176
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,180
An immense reward and various privileges.

177
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,840
Many are envious of them.

178
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,590
Also...

179
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,340
"Alchemists, work for the good of the public."

180
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,660
Alchemists, who are supposed to be searching for the truth,

181
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,760
turn into the army's human weapons
as soon as they earn their state qualifications.

182
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,220
And also, after that civil war in Ishbal,

183
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,320
there are many who hold a grudge against us.

184
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,770
Reporting.

185
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:16,540
Yesterday, around 9:30PM, many station employees witnessed a man with a large scar on his face at Central City Station.

186
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,120
Station?!

187
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,870
Did he run away?!

188
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,840
Our lives before I got my state qualification were terrible.

189
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,090
We were so poor.

190
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,130
My wife couldn't stand living in conditions like that, and she left our home.

191
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,800
I need to pass the assessment, no matter what...

192
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,980
I don't ever want to return to those days.

193
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,930
It's okay, Daddy!

194
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,780
If they tell you "No", Alexander and I will go and scold the higher-ups!

195
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,050
Nina sure is strong.

196
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,120
Nina... what do you say we play together tomorrow?

197
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,710
Really?!

198
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,890
Yeah.

199
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,300
Yay!

200
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,030
Alexander, Daddy said he'd play with us tomorrow!

201
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,790
Good morning, Mr. Tucker!

202
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,700
We're going to be using your place again today!

203
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,360
Huh?

204
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,720
Mr. Tucker?

205
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,790
Hey! Nina?

206
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,660
Mr. Tucker?

207
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,700
Oh, so you are here.

208
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,420
Hey...

209
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,640
It's complete. The finished product.

210
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,250
A chimera that understands human language.

211
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,950
Watch.

212
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,010
This person is Edward. Got it?

213
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,010
Ed...ward...

214
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,630
That's right! I'm so proud of you!

215
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,410
This is amazing... it really did talk.

216
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,270
Now I won't have to lose my state qualification.

217
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,200
Ed...ward...

218
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,450
Ed...ward...

219
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,020
Ed...ward...

220
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,620
O...nii...chan...

221
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,340
Mr. Tucker...

222
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,590
When did you get your state qualification again?

223
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,840
It was two years ago, I believe.

224
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,350
And when did your wife leave you?

225
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,600
Two years ago.

226
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,420
Can I ask you another question?

227
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,860
Nina and Alexander...

228
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,320
Where are they?!

229
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,820
I don't like sharp brats like you.

230
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,850
Brother!

231
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,640
Yeah, that's how it is!

232
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,050
You've done it, haven't you?!

233
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,540
It was your wife two years ago,

234
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,040
and this time, you used your daughter and your dog to transmute a chimera!

235
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,800
Since there are limits to animal experimentation, after all!

236
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,520
It must be a breeze if you use a human!!!

237
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,500
W-What's there to get angry about?

238
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,310
The mankind's advances are the product of many experiments on humans, aren't they?

239
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,980
If you're a scientist, too, then you should-

240
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,060
Don't screw around with me!!!

241
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,810
Do you really think something like this will be forgiven?!

242
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,320
Something like this... toying with human life?!

243
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,400
Human life?

244
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,320
Ah, human life, you say?

245
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,500
Fullmetal Alchemist!

246
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,860
Your limbs and your younger brother.

247
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,580
Aren't those the results of what you're saying right now? Toying with human life?

248
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,590
NO!!!

249
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,700
We're the same!

250
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,590
You and I!

251
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,590
No, we're not!!!

252
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,210
Yes, we are!

253
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,400
There was a possibility in front of us, so we tested it out.

254
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,980
Even though we knew it was taboo!

255
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,270
You're wrong!!!

256
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,020
I!

257
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,730
Alchemists!

258
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,760
Don't!

259
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,150
I... I!!!

260
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,950
Brother!

261
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,570
If you go any further, he'll die!

262
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,250
Da...ddy...

263
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,490
Does it hurt?

264
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,770
Da...ddy...

265
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,260
Does it hurt?

266
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,540
I'm sorry.

267
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,460
We can't change you back to normal with our powers.

268
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,780
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

269
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,070
Let's... play.

270
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,780
Let's play...

271
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,700
I made it in time.

272
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,790
With this, I can continue being a State Alchemist...

273
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,130
State Alchemist, my ass...

274
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,650
Stop kidding yourself...

275
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,600
Let's... play.

276
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,860
DAMMIT!!!

277
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,460
If something such as an act of the Devil exists in this world,

278
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,360
this case is just that.

279
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,640
The Devil, huh...

280
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:51,100
But if it is an order, State Alchemists must make
their move, without hesitation, to take human lives.

281
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,770
If it's about handling human lives,

282
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,460
there really isn't much difference between where we stand and what Mr. Tucker did.

283
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,630
You were aware of that, and yet you chose this path.

284
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,390
Am I right, Fullmetal?

285
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,810
I'm sure you'll run into incidents like this in the future again.

286
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,530
There may be times when you have to soil your hands.

287
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,850
Are you going to come to a stop like that every time it happens?

288
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,190
Whether they call me a dog of the military, or curse me as a devil,

289
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,290
Al and I will get back our bodies.

290
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,090
But...

291
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,690
We're neither devils,

292
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,300
nor gods at that!

293
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,410
We're humans...

294
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,100
We're just humans!!!

295
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,430
Puny, powerless humans...

296
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,750
...who can't even save one little girl.

297
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,820
I wonder why no one understands us...

298
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,470
...Nina...

299
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,610
You're Shou Tucker, aren't you?

300
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,820
Who are you?

301
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,250
Looks like... you're not from the military!

302
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,180
How did you get in?!

303
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,280
There should have been military policemen stationed out front!

304
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,180
Alchemists, who go against God's path...

305
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,230
...shall perish!

306
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,570
Da...ddy...

307
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,240
Da...ddy...

308
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,570
Daddy...

309
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,100
How miserable...

310
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,080
But now that you are in a state like that,
there is no way to return you to normal.

311
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,580
At the very least, leave this world in peace.

312
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,460
God,

313
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,850
two souls have just returned to your side.

314
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:17,000
Please usher them into your broad bosom,
and grant rest and salvation to their miserable souls.

315
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,000
Still grief-stricken over Nina's death,

316
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,040
Ed and Al are attacked by the mysterious man, Scar.

317
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,750
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

318
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,350
Episode 5, Rain of Sorrow.
