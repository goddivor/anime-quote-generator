1
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,350
So that's Roy Mustang.

2
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,070
The Flame Alchemist, eh?

3
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,950
An exceptional promotion at that age?
I wonder what kind of connections he used.

4
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,960
They say the faster you rise, the faster you fall.

5
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,130
Come in.

6
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,840
Sorry to bother you.

7
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,840
I am Colonel Roy Mustang.

8
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,320
Ah, Colonel Mustang.

9
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,750
I apologize. The FÃ¼hrer President is out right now.

10
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,070
To where?

11
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,730
He went to the South for an inspection.

12
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,880
South?

13
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,660
I don't like this smell.

14
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,370
But it smells familiar.

15
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,550
This is...

16
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,090
I simply came for an inspection,
but it seems I just discovered something.

17
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,890
Move in!

18
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,640
A brat and a housewife?! How grand.

19
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,990
But I'm kind of ill-matched for a fight.

20
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,780
I'll be making my escape.

21
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,660
You-

22
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,870
M-Master, hang in there!

23
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,520
Running away?! How cowardly...

24
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,820
Master...

25
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,820
Master! Master!!!

26
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,040
Stay...

27
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
...still...

28
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,020
N...o...

29
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,010
Greed!

30
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,500
Looks like you're okay, Martel.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,510
What happened? I haven't seen Roa and the others, either...

32
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,490
Yeah, things have become a little complicated.

33
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,080
We have to get out of here somehow.

34
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,260
I can't let you do that.

35
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,510
Huh? Who are you, old man?

36
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,090
FÃ¼hrer President!

37
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,510
Why are you here?

38
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,280
King Bradley?!

39
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,010
So what business does the most powerful guy in the country have with us?

40
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,100
How old are you?

41
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,330
Huh?

42
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,810
I'm turning sixty this year.

43
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,060
When you get old, your body starts to not move the way you want it to.

44
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,540
So I really want to get this over with and go home.

45
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,450
Retire already, gramps.

46
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're not just an ordinary geezer, are you?!

47
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,680
Greed?!

48
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,940
Now you've seen it.

49
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,110
A skill that has been passed down in the Armstrong household for generations... Sculpture Alchemy!!!

50
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,330
In that case, I won't hold back.

51
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,850
How strange...

52
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,560
We've ensured the safety of the boy and the housewife.

53
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,220
We'll proceed with the extermination of all the monsters!

54
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,020
It's an order from the FÃ¼hrer President!

55
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,760
It's been a while since anyone's gotten me so excited.

56
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,740
Nothing less to be expected from Sir Armstrong.

57
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,270
I also participated in the Ishbal extermination.

58
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
Former ally, eh?

59
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,210
Then all the more reason not to kill you.

60
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,810
Surrender at once.

61
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,860
Even though you're planning on killing me?

62
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,060
Major!

63
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,700
Roa!

64
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,050
Bastard!!!

65
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,550
You see,

66
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,050
I don't have an ultimate shield like you,

67
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,250
nor an ultimate spear that pierces diamond.

68
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,590
Do you understand how someone like that could have survived countless battles,

69
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,590
rendered distinguished service,
and has achieved the rank I have right now?

70
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,410
Y...ou...

71
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,270
Just as you have an ultimate shield,

72
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,610
I have an ultimate eye.

73
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,010
Now, Greed.

74
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,530
How many times do I have to kill you to get rid of you for good?

75
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,000
Where's Greed?

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,250
I don't know.

77
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,320
It's too dark; I can't see anything.

78
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,920
Greed?!

79
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,790
No!

80
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,060
Hey! Open up!

81
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,830
No!

82
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,950
Let me out!

83
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,210
I said no!

84
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,690
That was fifteen deaths, wasn't it?

85
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,140
How many more do you have? Hmm?

86
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,220
Y-You bastard...

87
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,560
Dammit...

88
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,080
The FÃ¼hrer President himself is here?

89
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,860
I don't mind if you run off with your tail between your legs.

90
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,250
I'd love to,

91
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,690
but dogs are loyal animals.

92
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,440
Please, get her out of here.

93
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,690
We're counting on you.

94
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,920
Roa?! Dolcetto?!

95
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,510
Hey, quit interfering! Let me out!

96
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,380
I won't!

97
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,750
I don't have time to mess with you!

98
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,550
I'm telling you to open up!

99
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,760
No! You can't come out!

100
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,930
Shut up and open up!

101
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,440
Are you telling me to just sit and watch my friends be killed?!

102
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,430
I can't let you out!

103
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,940
They asked me to keep you safe!

104
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,190
Dolcetto!!!

105
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,870
Roa!!!

106
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,660
Please, I'm begging you...

107
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,270
You can't... come out.

108
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,380
Hey, hey, Mister Bradley.

109
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,810
You really think you'll get away with doing this to my men?

110
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,780
You're feeling sympathetic now? How silly.

111
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,170
Sympathy?

112
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,650
Are you stupid?

113
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,310
Who do you think I am?

114
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,020
I'm Greed.

115
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,140
Money, women, subordinates...

116
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,400
...everything belongs to me!

117
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,550
Which is why I won't abandon what's mine.

118
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,910
I'm a greedy guy, after all!!!

119
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,190
Greedy? This is beyond silly.

120
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,930
How about you lie there for a while.

121
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,600
I have to get out of here...

122
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,460
Hang on.

123
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,430
You're Edward's brother, aren't you?

124
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,110
Are you hurt? Let me lend you a hand.

125
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,940
N-No, I'm fine.

126
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,090
I can go back by myself.

127
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,830
No, Martel!

128
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,050
No, Martel!

129
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,340
Bradley!!!

130
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,080
Al!!!

131
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,100
M-Mom!

132
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,930
Mom! Mom!!!

133
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,410
Al! Hang in there!

134
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,990
Hey, say something!

135
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,280
Al!

136
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,590
Brother...

137
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,350
You all right?

138
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,990
You're covered in blood, too, Brother...

139
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,750
I opened you up and pulled her body out.

140
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,590
I couldn't save her...

141
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,460
It's not your fault.

142
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,230
Come on. Let's go back.

143
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,460
Al...

144
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,560
Hold there.

145
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,580
I've got something I need to ask you both.

146
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,300
The mastermind of this incident, Greed. Is he an acquaintance of yours?

147
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,920
No, sir.

148
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,670
Did you happen to obtain
any important information from him?

149
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,760
Nothing that would benefit the army, no.

150
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,640
Don't misunderstand me. Not for the army.

151
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,390
If you were making a deal with them...

152
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,920
...depending on your answer...

153
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,480
Did you ally yourself with people whose intent was to harm the mainstay of the army?

154
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:21,900
No, sir.

155
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,390
Any other questions?

156
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,070
Your steel arm and your brother's body.

157
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,020
They're related, are they not?

158
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,590
You're an honest one.

159
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,640
Time to withdraw.

160
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,800
Take good care of your little brother, you hear?

161
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,100
I deeply appreciate you saving those two boys.

162
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,950
Don't worry about it.

163
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,420
It's one of the duties of the army to protect State Alchemists, too.

164
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,490
How about it?

165
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,030
Would you like to be protected by the army, too?

166
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,030
Become a State Alchemist?

167
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,820
Precisely.

168
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,420
As you can see, I'm a frail housewife.

169
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:26,090
Is this country so strained as to require the help of someone like me?

170
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,090
Harsh words!

171
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,720
I'll come again.

172
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,040
You may have changed your mind by then.

173
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,790
That Greed guy had a tattoo of Ouroboros on his hand.

174
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,630
Ouroboros...

175
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,330
You heard me telling Lt. Colonel Hughes, didn't you?

176
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,130
They're people who have something to do with the philosopher's stones.

177
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,810
Sir Hughes...

178
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,010
Edward Elric.

179
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,390
Don't do anything too reckless, all right?

180
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,090
Okay...

181
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,030
Well then...

182
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,860
Brother.

183
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,710
My memories of when my body was taken have returned.

184
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,130
How was it?!

185
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,880
Well...

186
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,860
It was kind of extraordinary...

187
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,100
But I couldn't find anything about human transmutation.

188
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,120
I see...

189
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,000
In the end, no progress, eh...

190
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,560
Not necessarily.

191
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,380
Remember what the FÃ¼hrer President said?

192
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,820
That there have been disquieting activities within the military.

193
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,690
Yeah, he said that it had something to do with philosopher's stones and the people who have tattoos of Ouroboros...

194
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,620
He said he wanted to catch them for that reason, right?

195
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,750
Greed also had that tattoo.

196
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,130
If so, why did he need to kill them all?

197
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,630
If he really wanted to know what they were up to,
he should have captured and interrogated them, right?

198
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,460
You're right.

199
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,960
And besides, it's strange the FÃ¼hrer President himself came to the battlefield when there weren't that many enemies.

200
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,390
Yeah. Everything just seems so fishy.

201
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,880
Guess we'll stick with the army for a little longer.

202
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,150
Welcome back, FÃ¼hrer President.

203
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,290
How did the inspection of the South go?

204
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,690
The Fullmetal Alchemist's brother...

205
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,450
...and perhaps their master, too.

206
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,800
Both of them may also be suitable sacrifices.

207
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,010
I also found something else that was unexpected.

208
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,100
Oh my, now that's someone I haven't seen in a while.

209
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,040
He left this place a century ago.

210
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,180
Wake up, Greed.

211
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,100
Oh wow, looks like everyone's here.

212
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,190
So much for your ultimate shield.

213
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,970
You look as gorgeous as you did a century ago.

214
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,950
Miss Lust, the "Ultimate Spear".

215
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,700
And Gluttony, you haven't lost weight at all.

216
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,330
And, Envy? You still dress like that?

217
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,420
Where's Sloth at?

218
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,970
He always skips out on meetings.

219
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,590
He's working right now.

220
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:07,430
Seriously, none of you guys have changed over a hundred years.

221
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,900
And who's this guy?

222
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,400
I am Wrath.

223
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,100
Wrath?

224
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,960
Aren't you King Bradley?

225
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:25,910
Yup. He's our last sibling Father created as a human by the name of King Bradley.

226
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,720
An aging Homunculus?!

227
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,440
Is that even possible?

228
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,270
"There's no way there's no way."

229
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,070
I thought that was a stock phrase of yours. Don't tell me you forgot?

230
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,040
Or are you going senile?

231
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,180
Shut your mouth, you ugly shit.

232
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,260
What was that?

233
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,230
Hey, I like those eyes. That's the way you ought to be.

234
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,440
How about you show your true colors every once in a while, Envy the Bizarre.

235
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,770
You piece of shit...

236
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,240
I'll kick your ass, if that's what you're asking for.

237
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,200
Cut it out, all of you.

238
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,870
Please don't fight among siblings, especially in front of your father.

239
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,440
Yo, old man.

240
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,030
Looks like you've aged a lot since the last time I saw you.

241
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,880
Greed.

242
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,270
You are my son who shares my soul.

243
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,560
Why did you betray me?

244
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,290
"Why"?

245
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,240
Shouldn't you know best?

246
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,880
I am Greed.

247
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,580
That's how you gave me life, and that's the way I've lived.

248
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,820
If I stayed by your side, I wouldn't be able to obtain everything my greedy soul desires.

249
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,330
Will you work for me again?

250
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,830
No can do!

251
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,960
I see...

252
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,600
I really don't like your tastes...

253
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,510
This is how hot I like my baths, damnit!

254
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:25,990
I'm sure the flames of Hell are hotter than this!

255
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:32,020
I'll go on ahead to see what it's like, my siblings!

256
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:40,000
Go back to where you came from, my soul, Greed!

257
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,970
You don't even have to ask!!!

258
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,010
Don't blame me if you get a stomachache, old man!!!

259
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,470
To the forthcoming day,

260
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,950
I pray for the unchanging loyalty of you all, along with peace and order.

261
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,170
Dad!

262
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,680
Welcome back, Dad!

263
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,180
Thank you, Selim.

264
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,640
How was the inspection?

265
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,730
It was a substantial inspection all right.

266
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,060
Dear, you're getting older...

267
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,660
Why not give up your position to a junior and relax?

268
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,700
No, no, I'm still in my prime.

269
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,970
Oh, that's right. I met the
Fullmetal Alchemist while in the South.

270
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,600
The short alchemist? Really?!

271
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,340
You really love hearing about Mr. Edward, don't you, Selim?

272
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,130
He's the youngest State Alchemist! That's just so cool!

273
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,640
That's awesome. I want to learn alchemy, too!

274
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,960
What in the world would you do with it?

275
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,630
I want to get a state qualification to be useful to Dad.

276
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,110
Then I might ask for your help in the future.

277
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:06,170
The pebbles foreigners throw into the water create ripples, and as they link together, they create a huge whirlpool.

278
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,510
Look! That's precisely what's happening right now.

279
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,090
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

280
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,600
Episode 15, A Messenger from the East.

281
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:24,880
I hide my blade behind my smile
and seek the Philosopher's Stone.
