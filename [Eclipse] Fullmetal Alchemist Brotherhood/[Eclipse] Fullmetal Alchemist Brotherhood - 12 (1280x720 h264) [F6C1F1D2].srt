1
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,980
We're almost at Dublith, Brother.

2
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,790
Were you dreaming?

3
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
Yeah.

4
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,300
A dream about him.

5
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,660
We're finally here, aren't we?

6
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,520
Yup.

7
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,340
I hope the Master isn't home...

8
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,220
Yeah...

9
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,740
H-Hi...

10
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,240
It's been a while...

11
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,030
Welcome.

12
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,620
You've gotten bigger.

13
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,290
I-I'm going to shrink...

14
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,270
Hi... It's me, Alphonse.

15
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,120
It's been a while.

16
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,710
You've really  gotten bigger.

17
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,200
That's the first time I've been patted on the head since I became like this.

18
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,140
Izumi, the Elric runts are here.

19
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,760
Think you can get up?

20
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,320
I'm fine.

21
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,340
I'm not feeling too bad today.

22
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,070
I guess she was lying down because she wasn't feeling well.

23
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,380
Has her body not healed yet?

24
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,000
You're one idiot of a disciple!

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,400
What's this I hear about you becoming a dog of the military?!

26
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,480
Master! W-Well... about this...

27
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,970
Al! Look at how much you've grown!

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,140
You haven't changed much either, Mast-

29
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,710
You've slacked on your training!

30
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,900
Oww...

31
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,200
I thought you weren't feeling well?

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,700
Forget about that! I'm out of bed like this because I heard you guys were here...

33
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,200
Don't push yourself.

34
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,500
You're worried about me, Dear?

35
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,350
I don't know much about the Philosopher's Stone.

36
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,580
Because I'm not interested.

37
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,090
I see...

38
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,470
We met an alchemist in Central who knew a lot about the stone, didn't we?

39
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,440
What was he like?

40
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,710
I think his name was...

41
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,540
...Hohenheim.

42
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,990
What's the matter?

43
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,500
So he's alive...

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,040
You know him?

45
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,670
He's our father.

46
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,690
So the one who left a long time ago...

47
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,210
That bastard!

48
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,470
It's his fault Mom died.

49
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,560
Because of him...

50
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,400
Oh! What are you doing up so early?

51
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,620
Al said he needed to pee...

52
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,780
Oh, so you were taking care of Al.

53
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,600
Thank you, Ed.

54
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,390
Mom, where's Dad?

55
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,400
He left.

56
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,330
When's he coming back?

57
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,130
Tickle tickle tickle!

58
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,550
Tickle tickle tickle!

59
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,870
He'll be back in no time.

60
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,010
Hurry and finish your meal, now.

61
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,500
Mom...

62
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,750
Mom.

63
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,820
Mom!

64
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,140
Mom!!!

65
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,280
So... did Dad say anything about the stone?

66
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,300
He looked happy, saying something about his wish from long ago will finally be coming true soon.

67
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,310
Ow!

68
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,410
Time to eat!

69
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,630
Okay...

70
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,160
You aren't going to eat, Al?

71
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,670
N-No!

72
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,080
I ate too much on the train...

73
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,630
Hey Al, tell them about how we witnessed childbirth over at Rush Valley!

74
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,810
Oh yeah!

75
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,520
Master, we helped a baby being born!

76
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,200
Idiot, that doesn't count as "helping".

77
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,740
I learned that people are born because everyone in the family works together,

78
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,330
the mother risks her life, and because the person receives so many blessings from everyone.

79
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,810
That's right.

80
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,050
That's how you two were given life, too.

81
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,290
Be proud that you were born.

82
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,670
Brother.

83
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,590
Hm?

84
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,550
Master hasn't changed at all, has she?

85
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,110
Nope.

86
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,310
She hasn't changed at all since we first met her.

87
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,890
Hang in there!

88
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,910
Bring over some more!

89
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,240
It's going to collapse!

90
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,420
The levee's going to break! Run for high ground!

91
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,610
Brother, look!

92
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,240
Hey, it's dangerous!

93
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,870
This should last for a while.

94
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,870
W-Who are you?

95
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,550
A passing housewife!

96
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,010
Will you please be our master, old lady?!

97
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,670
Please, old lady!

98
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,740
I couldn't catch exactly what you said...

99
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,230
Mind repeating it?

100
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,190
C-Correction!

101
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,280
Please be our master, Miss!

102
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,190
No!

103
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,380
Why not?!

104
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,840
I don't take students.

105
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,660
And besides, we're in the middle of a trip!

106
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,510
Please, accept us as your students!

107
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,720
God, you're so persistent!

108
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,180
Do you even have permission from your parents?!

109
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,040
The thing is... those boys don't have any parents.

110
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,030
I'm so soft when it comes to things like this...

111
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,060
Survive on your own!

112
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,230
Huh?

113
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,120
That's the preliminary round.

114
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,430
If you pass, we'll get to the real training.

115
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,240
And you're not allowed to use alchemy during this preliminary round.

116
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,490
What?

117
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,350
"One is All, All is One."

118
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,120
Find the answer to that within a month.

119
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,790
If you can't, I'm sending you back to Resembool.

120
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,540
Later!

121
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,670
Huh?!

122
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,990
What the heck?!

123
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,500
So hungry...

124
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,830
I want to sleep in a bed, geez...

125
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,830
What part of this is alchemy training?!

126
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,220
So hungry...

127
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,460
I wonder if those kids are all right?

128
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,020
They say there's no substitute for real-life experience.

129
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,220
That is the best way to pound the courage portion of alchemy into them.

130
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,770
If they don't learn anything from this,
it just means that's the extent of their talents.

131
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,060
They'll have to give up learning from me.

132
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,070
What I'm worried about is the safety of their lives.

133
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,640
I was thrown out to Mt. Briggs in the middle of winter for a month during my training!

134
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,310
Don't put yourself and ordinary people at the same level.

135
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,340
There's so much to eat on that island; they'll live.

136
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,210
We did it!

137
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,710
How do we eat this?

138
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,110
Hmm... We cut it apart.

139
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,360
Cut it apart...

140
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,880
I don't want to do it!

141
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,360
You do it!

142
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,450
I did the catching; you do the killing.

143
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,760
You always try to make me do all the things you don't want to do!

144
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Get back here!!!

145
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,330
Baby foxes...

146
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,720
Forget meat... let's try for some fish.

147
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,940
How do we catch one?!

148
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,630
We don't have a rod, line, or a needle!

149
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,600
No food, no fire, no nothing...

150
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't say that!

151
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,570
Geez!

152
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,790
What was that for, Brother?!

153
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,720
Brother?

154
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,800
Sour!

155
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm... alive.

156
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,720
Eating ants and living.

157
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,440
Eating life and living.

158
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,820
Living...

159
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,520
We're not going to die here!

160
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,370
Right!

161
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,870
Sorry about this...

162
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,060
You're almost there, Brother.

163
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,850
We did it!

164
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,900
Looks like tomorrow's the end of the month...

165
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,540
Hey Brother,

166
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,480
did you ever find the answer to "One is All, All is One"?

167
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:16,300
I've been thinking about it for the longest time, but I only kind of understand it.

168
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,050
I'm not positive, but...

169
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,810
Remember when I ate ants when we were starving and out of it?

170
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,450
You did?

171
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,370
Yep, I did.

172
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,320
They were so sour.

173
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,520
Then, a thought came to my mind.

174
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,400
If I hadn't eaten them and eventually died,

175
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,430
foxes and ants would eat me.

176
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,120
I'd return to the soil and become grass.

177
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,410
And that's what a rabbit would eat.

178
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,220
The food chain, right?

179
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,110
Yeah.

180
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,350
But that's not all.

181
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,150
Even this island could have been underwater in the ancient times.

182
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,340
And tens of thousands of years in the future,
it could be a summit of a mountain.

183
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,880
Everything is connected?

184
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,680
Everything is within a large stream that can't be seen.

185
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,360
I don't know if that stream should be called the universe or the world,

186
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,730
but from the point of view of something that big, you and I are like ants.

187
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,240
A small individual within a stream.

188
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,940
We're just "one" within the "all".

189
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:24,230
But only when those "ones" gather together, can an "all" exist.

190
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,170
It's the promised day.

191
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,640
Let's hear your answer to "One is All, All is One".

192
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,550
"All" is the world!

193
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,140
And "One" is me!

194
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,150
Good! We can start the real training now.

195
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,110
All right!

196
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,240
A basis of a transmutation circle is the power of the circle.

197
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,010
The circle displays the circulation of power,

198
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:03,040
and by sketching the construction symbol in it,
it becomes possible to activate its power.

199
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,340
This is also a circulation of power.

200
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,820
It's best to experience it for yourself.

201
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,440
Now...

202
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,280
Review it until lunch is ready!

203
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,780
Okay, so...

204
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,460
The circle displays the circulation of power,

205
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,070
and by sketching the construction symbol in it,
it becomes possible to activate its power.

206
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,910
But you were transmuting by just slapping your palms together, weren't you, Master?

207
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,670
Do you not need to sketch the construction symbols?

208
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,670
I am like a construction symbol.

209
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,590
What do you have to do in order to do that?

210
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,600
You might be able to do it if you ever reach the truth.

211
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,100
Master has also seen the truth...

212
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,890
And? What did you want to talk to me about?

213
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,160
W-Well...

214
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,680
As I thought, you can transmute without a construction symbol!

215
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,930
Additionally, Alphonse is an empty suit of armor!

216
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,460
You've got automails for an arm and leg!

217
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,080
How did you know, Master?!

218
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,110
I can tell from just sparring with you!

219
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,110
You... saw it, didn't you?

220
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,740
Am I right?!

221
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,030
Y-Yes, ma'am!

222
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,620
Both master and pupil, making the same stupid decisions.

223
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,100
Master, you...

224
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,090
Because you saw that thing...

225
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,470
We had a hard time conceiving a child.

226
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,180
Just when we thought we were having a baby, I fell ill.

227
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,760
Because of that, our child wasn't born into this world alive.

228
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,860
So...

229
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,110
...I committed taboo.

230
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,950
Thanks to that, all sorts of organs were taken from me.

231
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,600
I'm such an idiot.

232
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,030
I should have told you sooner.

233
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,500
It must have been tough.

234
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,430
N-No!

235
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,010
It's something we did to ourselves.

236
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,510
We don't particularly find it tough...

237
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,520
I think about what to eat when I get my body back.

238
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,900
It's quite the opposite; it's more of an anticipation!

239
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,170
Right, Brother?

240
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:57,770
Yeah!

241
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,200
That's exactly it!

242
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,980
You morons...

243
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,650
No need to force yourselves.

244
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,210
Forgive us...

245
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,460
We're sorry...

246
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,220
Forgive us...

247
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,470
We're sorry...

248
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,280
Forgive us...

249
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,350
We're sorry...

250
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,480
Forgive us...

251
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:42,360
This world is flowing while abiding by a great rule that's unimaginable.

252
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:46,630
Learning about that flow,
breaking it down, and rebuilding it.

253
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,120
That's what alchemy's all about.

254
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,150
And it's also what living is about, too.

255
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,440
The basics of alchemy, breaking
something down and rebuilding it...

256
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,720
That's almost like the food chain.

257
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,210
If you eat a rabbit, you break down
its meat and rebuild it into your own body.

258
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:10,140
And even that rabbit rebuilds
the grass it ate into its own body.

259
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,830
Alchemy is life itself.

260
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,830
A man who enjoys his own desires.

261
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,120
His name is Greed.

262
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:11,010
Whether he be friend or foe, the figure that stands before Ed and Al is a body made for fighting.

263
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:16,290
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

264
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,270
Episode 13, The Beasts of Dublith.

265
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,060
A powerful figure appears before the two.
