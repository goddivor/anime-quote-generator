1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,990
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,690
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,490
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,250
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,830
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,560
One must not commit this act.

7
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,930
Brother.

8
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,810
Hm?

9
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,660
What do you think about the rumors of the High Priest of Lior?

10
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,320
Miracles, huh?

11
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,000
He creates flowers out of nothingness, right?

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,520
It could just be a sleight of hand, but...

13
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,360
But if it isn't...

14
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,870
Yeah... It could be what we've been looking for.

15
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,320
A heavenly stone that destroyed Xerxes overnight.

16
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,950
The great elixir that had been sealed away by a sage from the west.

17
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,760
There are many names for it, but to put it simply, it is something that reinforces alchemy.

18
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,880
That is the Philosopher's Stone.

19
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,790
If we had this, we could get your body back...

20
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,390
Dammit! Why is this all that's written down?!

21
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,900
Al.

22
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,060
Yeah?

23
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,360
Wouldn't it be great if it's the real stone this time?

24
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,530
Yeah. Definitely.

25
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,410
10 Years Ago   Resembool

26
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,410
Ed, Al, where are you?

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,870
Oh my...

28
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,410
Scattering Daddy's studies again.

29
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,870
Hey, no doodling on the floor.

30
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,540
I'm not doodling.

31
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,080
Watch!

32
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,760
That's... alchemy, isn't it?

33
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,920
Did you learn that from Daddy?

34
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,460
How do we learn from someone who's not even here?

35
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,740
It was in the books we read.

36
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,140
Was in the books...

37
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,150
Were we not supposed to?

38
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,150
No, of course not!

39
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,190
You boys are amazing! As expected of Daddy's children.

40
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,030
I'm going to have to brag to everyone about you two!

41
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Mom praised us.

42
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,990
Because we liked that, we started getting into alchemy.

43
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,420
But... in the summer of that year...

44
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,990
Mom passed away due to an epidemic.

45
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,110
Brother... I'm hungry.

46
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,050
It's cold, too. Let's go home...

47
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,030
If Dad comes home-

48
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,530
Don't talk about him!

49
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,380
He's not our Dad!

50
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,310
He didn't even come back for Mom's funeral.

51
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,270
I wonder if we could bring Mom back...

52
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,610
But one of the books said that
transmutating humans isn't allowed.

53
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,420
So... We'll keep it between us, all right?

54
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,210
You guys are here again.

55
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,130
What do you want, Winry?

56
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:46,340
Grandma said that if you cry for someone who's passed away, that person grieves as much as you cried for them.

57
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,860
We're not crying!

58
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,600
You're the one who cries all the time 'cause
your parents are always gone and you're lonely!

59
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,060
I-I never cry!

60
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,720
Really?

61
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,840
I'm sorry I was ever worried about you now!

62
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,470
If you get home later than me, you don't get any supper!

63
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,090
What the heck is that? Wait up!

64
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,450
W-Wait for me!

65
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,750
Itadakimasu!

66
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,020
Ed, you have to drink your milk, too.

67
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,910
I hate milk.

68
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,030
If you don't drink it, you'll be a runt forever.

69
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,630
Who are you calling a runt, you midget hag!

70
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,630
What was that?! You pea-sized runt!

71
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,100
Minimum hag!

72
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,160
Micro runt!

73
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
You're no bigger than an ant!

74
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,470
You're no bigger than a flea!

75
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,560
You were reading your book in school again...

76
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,430
You have to pay attention in class, you know.

77
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,190
Oh, shut up.

78
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,030
So, what book were you reading?

79
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,280
It's a secret.

80
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,530
None of your business, Winry.

81
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,340
That's no fair! You two always keep little secrets!

82
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,710
Later!

83
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,540
Ed! Al! We're having stew tonight!

84
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,070
Awesome!

85
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,340
Okay. We'll see you later!

86
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,390
The person who invented stew is amazing.

87
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,110
There's milk in it, yet it tastes so good.

88
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,260
What the heck?

89
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,010
The fact they thought of adding milk to vegetable soup is amazing.

90
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,210
It's important for scientists to drastically change their thinking sometimes.

91
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,730
I wonder...

92
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,140
Yeah!

93
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,730
Human transmutation probably needs something drastic like that, too!

94
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,210
From then on, we researched human transmutation...

95
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:38,040
...and improved our abilities by training with
our alchemy master in order to revive our mother.

96
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,750
It took many years, but...

97
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,130
"I want to see Mom's smiling face again."

98
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,460
"I want to live happily with Mom again."

99
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,160
With those thoughts in our hearts, we...

100
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,520
There.

101
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Water, 35L.

102
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,790
Carbon, 20kg.

103
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,530
Ammonia, 4L.

104
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,790
Lime, 1.5kg.

105
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,550
Phosphorus, 800g.

106
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,560
Salt, 250g.

107
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,570
Niter, 100g.

108
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,550
Sulfur, 80g.

109
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,560
Fluorine, 7.5g.

110
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,090
Iron, 5g.

111
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,790
Silicon, 3g.

112
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,420
All right, let's write the construction formula.

113
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,590
All that's left is the information about the soul.

114
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,030
Let's do this, Al.

115
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,980
Right.

116
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,700
Brother, something's wrong.

117
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,790
Al!

118
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,130
Could this be... rebound?!

119
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,840
Brother!!!

120
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,020
Brother! Brother...

121
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,130
Brother!

122
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,930
BROTHER!!!

123
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,260
Al?

124
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,300
Huh? What was I doing?

125
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,020
Yo.

126
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,200
Who're you?

127
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,530
Why, thanks for asking.

128
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,230
I'm an existence that you folks like to call the "world".

129
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,300
In other words, the universe. In other words, God.

130
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,260
In other words, the "Truth". In other words, entirety.

131
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,000
In other words, "one". And, I'm...

132
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,420
...you.

133
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,870
Welcome.

134
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,800
Mr. I'm-an-idiot-who-acts-all-high-and-mighty.

135
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,370
So noisy...

136
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,600
Isn't this what you wanted?

137
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,070
I'll show you the "truth".

138
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,100
It was as though all of the information in the world was shoved directly into my head.

139
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,330
Stop it! My head's gonna burst!

140
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,170
I'm being disassembled...

141
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,930
No! Stop it!

142
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,470
Stop!!!

143
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,800
I felt like my head was going to crack open.

144
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,350
But I suddenly realized.

145
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,270
This is the "Truth".

146
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,140
M... Mom...

147
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,280
How was it?

148
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,910
That's right...

149
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,830
There were no errors in my human transmutation theory...

150
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,040
But I'm missing something!

151
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,350
If I had gone a little further...

152
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,750
I would've found what I was looking for; the truth to human transmutation!

153
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,160
Please! Show it to me again!

154
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,050
No, no, no.

155
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,370
I can only show you that much for that toll you've paid.

156
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,810
Toll?

157
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,690
Yes, toll.

158
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,360
Equivalent exchange, is it not?

159
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,320
Mr. Alchemist.

160
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,080
Dammit! Like I'd let this happen...

161
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,590
This... This wasn't...

162
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,460
Dammit!!!

163
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,230
They took it away!!!

164
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,090
Help me... someone...

165
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,400
Mom... Mom...

166
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,590
No way... No...

167
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,590
This isn't...

168
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,610
This isn't what I wanted!!!

169
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,450
Al... Alphonse...

170
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,660
Alphonse! Alphonse!!!

171
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,200
Because of me...

172
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,380
Alphonse!!!

173
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,860
Dammit... Dammit!!!

174
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,100
Give him back... He's my little brother...

175
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,470
Whether it be an arm or a leg...

176
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,730
Or even my heart! You can take it!

177
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,310
So give him back...

178
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,560
He's my only brother!!!

179
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,950
Yo. You were still hangin' around in Central?

180
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,220
They're letting me return to Eastern Headquarters.

181
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,090
Well, good work.

182
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,220
You'd better at least be a Brigadier General the next time you come, all right, Colonel?

183
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,840
You say that as if it's a walk in the park.

184
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,950
Oh yeah, if you're going back,
I'll go ahead and give this to you now.

185
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,870
What is it?

186
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,220
It's the final report about Isaac McDougal.

187
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,400
You haven't seen it yet, have you?

188
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:32,790
Yeah.

189
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,580
Eastern Alchemy from Xing?

190
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,690
Apparently, something like that exists.

191
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,570
To be honest, I've got no idea, but...

192
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,680
Do you have a clue?

193
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,740
No, never heard of it.

194
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,690
By the way, how are the Elric brothers doing?

195
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,490
I'm not their keeper.

196
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,370
Hey, why did you have Ed become a State Alchemist?

197
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,540
He's still a kid, you know?

198
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,760
As long as you're in the army,
you will experience Hell someday.

199
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,680
Just like we did.

200
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,350
Hell, huh...

201
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,690
If it's Hell, they've seen it already.

202
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,330
Plenty of it, in fact...

203
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,780
4 Years Later

204
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,230
Lt. Colonel, they're not in the backyard ei-

205
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,120
What is this...

206
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,400
Where are they?

207
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,540
Where are those Elric brothers?!

208
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,290
Pipe down, Den.

209
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,170
To customers, you have to...

210
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,030
Hey! What business does a soldier have here?

211
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,950
I just came from your house!

212
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,100
What in the world is all that?!

213
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,610
What did you make?!

214
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,480
Sorry... Please forgive us.

215
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,000
We're sorry... We're sorry...

216
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,020
We're sorry...

217
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,660
You're...

218
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,250
I was shocked.

219
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,410
I heard there was a talented alchemist, so I came here.

220
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,670
To think that a child performed human transmutation, though it was incomplete,

221
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,030
and even managed to affix a soul.

222
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,890
He has more than enough to be a State Alchemist.

223
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:39,640
If he became a State Alchemist, he'd have to fight as a soldier during times of emergencies.

224
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,750
At the same time, the position comes with many privileges, and they'd be allowed to perform research of the highest level.

225
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,570
They may be able to discover
a way to recover their bodies...

226
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:57,770
After these boys staggered in here
covered in blood, I went to their house.

227
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,330
That...

228
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,710
That was not human!

229
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,210
Is alchemy what allowed them to create something horrible like that?!

230
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,760
Then I'm against it!

231
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,340
Are you telling these boys to look at Hell again?!

232
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,720
Please.

233
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,370
Thank you.

234
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,270
Umm... Lieutenant...

235
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,430
Just call me Riza.

236
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,990
Riza Hawkeye. Nice to meet you.

237
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,270
Ms. Riza...

238
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,660
Have you ever shot somebody?

239
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,500
I have.

240
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,540
I don't like soldiers.

241
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,470
Because Mom and Dad were taken to a battlefield and killed there.

242
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,130
And on top of that, you two are trying to take Ed and Al, too...

243
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,770
Whether they come or not is up to them.

244
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,650
Yes... up to them.

245
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,330
I won't force you.

246
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,780
I'm just presenting you with the possibilities.

247
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,900
Whether they want to move forward or stay stuck in place.

248
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,450
Whether you want to end your life in despair or bow down to the army, seeking what possibilities lie there.

249
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,660
It's those boys who have to make the decision.

250
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:27,090
If the possibility lies on that path, then you should move forward to return your body to normal.

251
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,960
Even if that path is a muddy river.

252
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,060
Why did you become a soldier, Ms. Riza?

253
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,250
Because I have someone I want to protect.

254
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,510
We're leaving.

255
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,380
Yes, sir.

256
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,660
Well, this is good-bye, young lady.

257
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,620
My name is Winry.

258
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,180
I see. Winry.

259
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,130
I hope we'll meet again.

260
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,750
I wonder if he'll come?

261
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,720
He will.

262
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,380
But his eyes looked spiritless...

263
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,390
You think so?

264
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,220
Those... were burning eyes.

265
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,850
You won't regret it, will you?

266
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,160
Nope, I've already decided.

267
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,370
How long would it take for both the surgery and rehab?

268
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,280
I'd say about three years.

269
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,270
One year.

270
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,910
You're gonna be coughing up blood.

271
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,900
Al, put up with it for a little longer, will ya?

272
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,140
I'll put you back in your body.

273
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,050
Yeah.

274
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,300
But when that time comes,
you're going to get your limbs back, too.

275
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,520
Yeah.

276
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,590
Your body's all fixed up now, don't you think?

277
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,920
Yeah! Just alchemy left to train now.

278
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,950
Since I haven't used it since.

279
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,190
Oh, so you haven't used it since you affixed my soul.

280
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,210
Brother!

281
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,580
Perfect, perfect.

282
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,440
That's amazing, Brother! You did it without a transmutation circle!

283
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,370
Just like how our master does it!

284
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,580
You can do it, too, can't you?

285
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,380
No, Brother.

286
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,590
You didn't see it?

287
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,830
See... what?

288
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,420
No... never mind.

289
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,270
Hey!!

290
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,920
You transformed my automail, didn't you?!

291
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,570
So you're gonna transform my head instead?!

292
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,210
Ow... geez...

293
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,320
Uncute machine freak.

294
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,170
Like I care if I'm not cute!

295
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,680
I'm fine with being a machine freak, too!

296
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,670
I've decided to support you until you get your limbs back!

297
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,200
Wha?

298
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,940
It's quite rare that you've decided to watch the exam, sir.

299
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,860
Well, I heard that a twelve year-old was being tested,

300
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,970
so I just thought I'd drop by so I would have something to talk about with my family.

301
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
Ah, an arm made of steel...

302
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,650
I got it during the civil war in the west...

303
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,360
Yeah, we sure had a lot of trouble with Ishbal.

304
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,560
Who's that guy?

305
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,280
Idiot! That's FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley!

306
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,700
Now, let the examination begin.

307
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,550
Do you have something to draw a transmutation circle with?

308
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,330
I don't need something like that.

309
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,170
Without a transmutation circle...

310
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,230
Now this is quite something...

311
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,060
Your Excellency!

312
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,050
...And some military figure may be assassinated like this, so...

313
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,300
You guys might want to think about changing this examination.

314
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,760
Hmm, he's certainly got a lot of pluck.

315
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,210
But he doesn't understand the size of this world.

316
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,490
Good luck with the rest of your exams, young alchemist.

317
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,090
When did he draw his sword?

318
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,260
I wonder if Brother is doing all right on the exams...

319
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,440
Hey, Al.

320
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,170
Hm? What's up?

321
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,340
If Ed becomes a State Alchemist...

322
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,800
...will you be leaving this town?

323
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,980
Yeah.

324
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,610
This is the badge of a State Alchemist, the silver pocket watch.

325
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,340
East City
Eastern Headquarters

326
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,680
Your certificate and the agreements are... here...

327
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,600
The FÃ¼hrer President has given you quite the ironic title...

328
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,830
What?

329
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,640
No, congratulations.

330
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,270
You're now a dog of the military.

331
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,140
I, FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley, hereby appoint...

332
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,880
...thou, Edward Elric, as a State Alchemist,

333
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,530
and bestow thee with the title, "Fullmetal".

334
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,030
Fullmetal?

335
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,380
That's right.

336
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,570
The second name that's given to all State Alchemists.

337
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,160
The name that you'll be carrying is...

338
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,230
"Fullmetal Alchemist".

339
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,170
I like it. Sounds like something heavy to carry.

340
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,050
But I'll do it.

341
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,300
Brother, we're almost there.

342
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,730
Lior, huh...

343
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,950
There should be some clue there on how to get Al's body back...

344
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,740
The Philosopher's Stone...

345
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:05,130
Ed and Al, arriving in the city of Lior, meet Cornello, a man who preaches the revival of the dead.

346
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,170
Pray and believe, and thou shall be saved.

347
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:13,550
As Cornello preached those words, he wore the bright, red, Philosopher's Stone on his finger.

348
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,140
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

349
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,800
Episode 3, City of Heresy.

350
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,440
What, exactly, is the happiness that can be earned by turning away from reality?
