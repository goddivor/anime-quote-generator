1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,050
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,730
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,750
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,290
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,880
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,210
One must not commit this act.

7
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,950
Maes Hughes is dead.

8
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,900
He was murdered by mysterious people who have tattoos of Ouroboros.

9
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:14,800
Mustang, doubtful of the reason behind Hughes' death, upon learning the military leadership had a hand in the plot,

10
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,440
decided to make his way to Central.

11
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:28,250
At the same time, Ed and Al, knowing nothing of this, headed south with Winry toward Dublith where their master lives.

12
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,590
However...

13
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,920
Rush Valley!

14
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,420
Automail!

15
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,930
Automail~

16
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,430
Automail!

17
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,820
I'm so blessed!

18
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,380
It's a Gotts eleventh year model!

19
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,120
I never thought I'd be able to lay my eyes on one!

20
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,830
As expected from the Holy Land of Automails.

21
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,600
This place is packed.

22
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,660
Where's the fun in staring at automails all day in this hot weather?

23
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,710
We should have just left Winry
and headed straight for Dublith!

24
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,920
Hey you, do you have a moment?

25
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,780
This automail's a rare make.

26
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,430
You're right. Take a look, everyone.

27
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,870
Hey.

28
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,840
Hey, whoa-

29
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,260
SFX: Bump, Push

30
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,000
Cut it out! C-Cut it-

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,310
I said cut it out! N-Not there!

32
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,270
No! N-No!!!

33
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,940
Everyone's so eager to learn!

34
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,770
Get off me!

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,090
Geez... This is why I can't stand automail mechanics...

36
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,450
U-Umm...

37
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,870
Huh?

38
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,910
What's wrong?

39
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,580
I can't find it...

40
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,700
Find what?

41
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,750
The sign of a State Alchemist...

42
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,290
...my silver pocket watch!

43
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,630
I can't find it.

44
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,710
That's probably Paninya's doing.

45
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,140
Paninya?

46
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,010
She's a pickpocket who goes after tourists.

47
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,200
Any idea where she is?

48
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,940
It's something really important!

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,800
I don't mind telling ya...

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,910
...But in exchange...

51
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,520
Let me see your automail one last...

52
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,280
She's at an automail mechanic by the name of Dominique's place!

53
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,950
They said he lives deep in the mountains because you can find high quality ore, but...

54
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,950
This really is the right path... right?

55
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,410
They didn't trick us, did they?

56
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,510
It's your fault for saying you wanted to go to that city in the first place!

57
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,540
Getting your silver pocket watch stolen was due to your own carelessness!

58
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,510
Shut up!

59
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,190
Hey, you two!

60
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,970
What do you want?!

61
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,620
Isn't that the girl?

62
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,820
Found her!!!

63
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,960
Give it back...

64
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,130
You're amazing! What the heck are you?

65
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm... an alchemist!

66
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,060
Wow, awesome!

67
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,310
Moving about so much...

68
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,940
Hey, you're running out of breath!

69
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,750
I've been waiting for you.

70
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,120
Well done!

71
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,170
What do you say you give it back now...

72
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,040
...my silver pocket watch...

73
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,260
It's not really a rare sight, is it?
Considering the city you were just at.

74
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,470
And also...

75
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,260
A 1.5 inch culverin in my left leg.

76
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,800
Wait!

77
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,310
Catch me if you can!

78
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,290
Don't even try to escape!

79
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,030
Good work, Winry! Don't let go of her!

80
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,690
That's the plan!

81
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,410
I won't let go of you until you let me examine your automail!

82
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,890
Oh my, Paninya.

83
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,500
You brought friends over?

84
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,140
Give up already!

85
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,450
Well, about that...

86
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,640
It's my first time seeing an automail like this!

87
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,290
The suspension is powerful, but what's even more amazing is the overall balance!

88
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,560
This efficient design is a work of art!

89
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,630
Umm... about my silver pocket watch...

90
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,440
This is amazing! How did they do this?

91
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,440
It's no use, Brother...

92
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,890
You have my deepest respect for being able to make such an automail!

93
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,280
No, I'm not the one who made it.

94
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,270
It's mine.

95
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,290
Isn't it a bit heavy?

96
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,350
Yeah... I agree.

97
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,110
It's not good to put a strain on the recipient.

98
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,470
Maybe that's why this guy's so small?

99
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,760
Don't call me small!

100
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,840
Which means I'd get bigger if it's made lighter.

101
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,760
There's a possibility.

102
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,670
You're huge, Brother!

103
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,350
You're so tall!

104
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,400
You guys are so puny.

105
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,720
I've decided.

106
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,910
Mister Dominique!

107
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,900
Hmm?

108
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,740
Please make me your apprentice!

109
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,700
No can do.

110
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,440
You could at least give it a little more thought...

111
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,730
Shut up. I don't take apprentices.

112
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,610
I'm begging you!

113
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,420
Could you please teach her how to build an automail that would help me grow?

114
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,710
Shut up, flea.

115
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,570
Sorry about that.

116
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,650
My old man's pretty stubborn.

117
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,470
Yeah...

118
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,860
Flea... Flea...

119
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,690
Flea...

120
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,690
Hm?

121
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,940
That's... a baby, right?

122
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,400
That's right.

123
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,500
Can I feel your belly?

124
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,460
Sure, go ahead.

125
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,550
It's kind of mysterious.

126
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,790
Yeah.

127
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,010
It's weird to think we were in
our mom's womb like this once, too...

128
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,570
Are you all right?!

129
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,290
Y-Yeah...

130
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,100
The junctions start to ache when the weather is no good.

131
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,290
Why do you wear an automail?

132
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,470
I lost both my parents and my legs in a train accident.

133
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,840
It really felt like the end of the world for me,

134
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:46,370
since I had no relatives, nor was I able to walk at all.

135
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,270
And that's when I met Mister Dominique.

136
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,410
You've got a look saying,
"I'm the most miserable person in the world".

137
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,280
Ones like you piss me off the most!

138
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,110
Let me go! Let me go!

139
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,470
Eyes of a corpse.

140
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,640
I probably looked dreadful back then...

141
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,330
And so, while I had no idea what was going on, he stuck these on me.

142
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:31,330
The surgery was painful, and the rehab was backbreaking; everything was horrible.

143
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,480
But...

144
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,420
When I was able to stand on my feet again,
I felt like the world was mine.

145
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm really thankful to Mister Dominique.

146
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,830
I plan on repaying the debt,
even if it takes my whole life to do it.

147
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,430
Even though I've never gotten him to accept any kind of payment...

148
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,010
So that's why you pickpocket...

149
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,130
If you're truly thankful, then stop pickpocketing!

150
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:01,760
Huh?

151
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,100
Mister Dominique gave you these legs in good faith.

152
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,440
So you have to respond to that with the same, too!

153
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,780
If you're really planning on spending your whole life trying to repay him, stand up and work hard to earn money!

154
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,610
With those legs he gave you!

155
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,120
I'm sure that would make Mister Dominique much happier.

156
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,080
I see...

157
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,040
You're right!

158
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,460
Yeah! I'll stop pickpocketing!

159
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,370
I'll repay him by earning money honestly!

160
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,920
Oh, that's right...

161
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,090
I have to give this back to him.

162
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,060
Right!

163
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,830
Huh?

164
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,540
Uh-oh... Did I break it?

165
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,220
It won't open...

166
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,390
Let me see.

167
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,350
No, he's sealed it with alchemy.

168
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,140
How come?

169
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,900
The answer is obvious.

170
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,780
Because there's something embarrassing in here he doesn't want anyone else to see!

171
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,780
SFX: Chuckle

172
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,000
Got it!

173
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,470
Now, let's see what Ed's got in here...

174
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,390
"Don't forget. 3. Oct. 11."

175
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,040
What is this?

176
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,040
Please give this back to Ed.

177
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,470
Winry?

178
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,180
I'm...

179
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,990
I'm going to try asking Mister Dominique for an apprenticeship again!

180
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,330
What's wrong?

181
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,400
B-Being bo...

182
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,770
Bingo?

183
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,650
Being bo... Bo...

184
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,620
What about bingo?

185
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,300
B...

186
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,240
B-

187
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,450
Miss Sadila says the baby's being born!!!

188
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,560
We can't take her to a hospital in the city in this weather.

189
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,010
I'll rush over there and bring back a doctor.

190
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,300
My old man will be back with a doctor soon.

191
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,610
Just hang in there, okay?

192
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,940
I can't exactly "hang in there"
if the baby's trying to come out...

193
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,180
What's wrong?!

194
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,500
What's she saying? I can't make it out.

195
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,120
The baby's being born!

196
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,870
B... B... Being born?!

197
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,170
What are we going to do?! There's no doctor around!

198
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,620
What are we going to do?! What are we going to do?!

199
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,740
Hey, you! What are we going to do?!

200
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,050
We have to do it!

201
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,990
Do what?

202
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,230
The delivery.

203
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,470
What?!

204
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,560
D-Do you have experience delivering a baby?

205
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,680
I don't. But...

206
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,360
We don't have time to sit around, either!

207
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,060
We need to work together to help the baby be born!

208
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,530
Ed and Al, you two go boil some water!

209
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,570
Got it!

210
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,870
Paninya, collect all the towels you can find!

211
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,790
Roger!

212
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,580
And Mr. Riddle, do you have any rubbing alcohol?

213
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,340
I think we have some in the storehouse!

214
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,190
Oh, and please prepare some water for Miss Sadila to drink!

215
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,220
Say... Do you think she can handle this?

216
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,980
She was born into a family of doctors,

217
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,920
so she basically grew up reading medical books.

218
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,880
Yup.

219
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,560
What?! Then that means she didn't actually study how to...

220
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,900
I'm sure she only remembers those things vaguely.

221
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,240
No way...

222
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,530
But right now,

223
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,680
we need to put faith in her knowledge and courage.

224
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,220
First, boil water, then sterilization...

225
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,460
What else is there to do?

226
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,610
Try to remember... Try to remember...

227
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,790
Winry.

228
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,590
You can do it!

229
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,690
Yeah.

230
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,980
Paninya, help me out in here.

231
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,630
O-Okay.

232
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,330
Brother...

233
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,240
I'm always powerless in critical moments...

234
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,500
Oww! Oww! Oww! Oww!!!

235
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm going to die!

236
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,500
SFX: Tremble

237
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,850
It hurts so much!

238
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,510
I can't take it anymore!!!

239
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,180
I don't believe in God, but...

240
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,510
Yeah.

241
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,770
If you exist, then please... just for now...

242
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,810
Brother!

243
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,490
H-Hey!

244
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,870
B-Blood...

245
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,560
I can't... take it...

246
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,880
What happened? Hey!

247
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,100
She did it!

248
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,380
Hooray!

249
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,880
That's awesome! The baby was really born!

250
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,140
That's so awesome! Awesome, I tell you!

251
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,230
You sound like a little kid saying that.

252
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,120
Think about it! It's the birth of a life!

253
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,870
It's what alchemists have been spending hundreds of years trying to do.

254
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,160
A human creating a human.

255
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,160
Don't group alchemy with the mysteries of life.

256
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,750
I can't help it; I'm an alchemist.

257
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,440
But still, that's awesome.

258
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,510
Humans are awesome.

259
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,120
Well, since the baby was safely born,

260
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,590
is there anything I can help out with?

261
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,350
Good question.

262
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,810
For starters, help me up...

263
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,820
Huh?

264
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,000
It's humiliating to be carried by a guy shorter than me.

265
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,660
Don't make me drop you.

266
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,280
Ed...

267
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,160
Hm?

268
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,520
I saw what you wrote inside your silver pocket watch...

269
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,550
Oww...

270
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,240
Did you force it open?

271
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,720
Sorry...

272
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,300
Idiot.

273
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,300
I haven't even shown it to Al.

274
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,290
But why?

275
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,220
A lesson for myself and to show my determination.

276
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,780
It's kind of girly of me.

277
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,510
That I have to hold on to that day in a shape like this...

278
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,490
Why are you  crying?

279
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,990
There's no going back now...

280
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Yeah.

281
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,270
Why are you  crying?

282
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,720
I'm crying for  you, since neither you nor Al ever cry.

283
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,530
Idiot.

284
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,500
Hey... I think you should go back to Resembool.

285
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,410
Granny's probably lonely being all by herself.

286
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,190
No, I'm not going back.

287
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,120
Hey...

288
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,730
After seeing your determination...

289
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,490
I can't be walking around with
half-assed determination, either.

290
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,200
No, it's not like you have to carry the burden either...

291
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,560
I want to keep getting better,

292
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,350
so I can equip you with better automail.

293
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,150
So you can continue your journey with peace of mind.

294
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,670
So I'm going to try asking Mister Dominique for an apprenticeship again!

295
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,010
I see...

296
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,480
Good luck.

297
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:07,920
Thanks.

298
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,480
Winry, Mister Riddle wants to see you.

299
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,730
Huh? What's the matter?

300
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,210
No, it's nothing. I'll be right there.

301
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,610
Paninya...

302
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,700
Oww! What was that for?!

303
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,340
Shut up! Give me my watch back, you thief!

304
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,140
You didn't have to hit me with your right hand!

305
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,760
Then I'll hit you again with my left!

306
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,090
It's your grandpa!

307
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,580
So cute!

308
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,920
His personality's changed...

309
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,590
Both you and your baby are in excellent condition.

310
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,640
The post-birth care was also very well done.

311
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,510
Even an adult would panic if they happened to witness childbirth for the first time.

312
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,340
Oh! Well... I panicked a little.

313
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,440
I owe all of you a huge thank you.

314
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,830
Especially you, young lady.

315
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,230
Thank you so much.

316
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,050
Please don't be so formal!

317
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,790
Oh, geez... I'm embarrassed.

318
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,680
How about it? Taking an apprentice here might be a...

319
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,560
This and that are two different things.

320
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,270
I won't take any apprentices.

321
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,010
But, if you insist...

322
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,300
I'll introduce you to a skilled technician that lives at the foot of the mountain.

323
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,430
U-Umm...

324
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,660
Can I visit to observe your work from time to time?

325
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,280
You can come visit to see my grandchild, sure.

326
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,830
You, too, Paninya!

327
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,360
Oh no! Hurry!

328
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,450
If we miss it, we're going to have to wait
another three days for the next train to Dublith!

329
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,160
Take care of yourselves, now!

330
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,160
You, too!

331
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,630
Be sure you give Granny a call!

332
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,130
I don't want to hear that from you !

333
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,480
Make sure you steal that geezer's techniques,

334
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,320
so you can equip me with a
better automail the next time you see me!

335
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,460
And there he goes.

336
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,710
You can count on me.

337
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,160
The boys reminisce of the times they were in training...

338
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,690
...when they visit Dublith, the city where their master lives.

339
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,730
That becomes their first step toward the truth.

340
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,340
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

341
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:19,360
Episode 12, One is All, All is One.

342
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,890
He hesitates to speak,

343
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,770
because he wants to protect them.
