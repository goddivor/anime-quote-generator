1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:06,130
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:11,740
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,880
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,290
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,950
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,780
One must not commit this act.

7
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,390
Scar, a man who only targets State Alchemists,

8
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,650
attacked Edward Elric.

9
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,460
Although Ed accepted death at Scar's hand,

10
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,650
his life was saved thanks to interference by Colonel Mustang and his men.

11
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,790
Ed and Al, who discovered the joy of being alive,

12
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:28,500
decided to return to their birthplace, Resembool, to restore their bodies.

13
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,590
Yo.

14
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,330
Lt. Colonel Hughes.

15
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,340
The guys at Eastern Headquarters said that they were too busy to come.

16
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,020
So I'm here to see you off instead.

17
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,850
That's fine with me, but...

18
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,050
...why is the Major...

19
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,490
It's only natural you'd get an escort.

20
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,480
Getting attacked by Scar in your state wouldn't be too pretty, would it?

21
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,160
Just accept the Major's kindness.

22
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,630
Children don't need to be reserved.

23
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,030
Don't treat me like a kid!

24
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,750
And Al is going to be on this ride, too, right?

25
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,540
Of course.

26
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,310
I thought he'd be lonely riding alone.

27
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,550
What the hell do you take my brother for?!

28
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,340
Oh, it's time.

29
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,580
Well guys, take care.

30
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,280
If you ever happen to stop by Central again, come say hi.

31
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,300
Dr. Marcoh!

32
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,830
You're Dr. Marcoh, aren't you?!

33
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,790
It's me, Alex Louis Armstrong from Central!

34
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,820
Someone you know?

35
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,750
He's a talented alchemist who used to reside in Central.

36
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,300
He was studying how to apply alchemy to medical treatment,

37
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,910
but he had been reported missing after the civil war in Ishbal.

38
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,460
Let's get off here, Major.

39
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,450
I have a feeling he'd know something about the transmutation of living organisms.

40
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,400
Do you know someone who looks like this?

41
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,610
Wow, you're good at drawing.

42
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,770
Drawing portraits is a skill that has been passed down in the Armstrong household for generations.

43
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,170
This is Dr. Mauro, isn't it?

44
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,770
"Mauro"?

45
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,190
We were in a tight spot because our doctors were drafted for the civil war.

46
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,520
I don't know what would have happened if Dr. Mauro hadn't come.

47
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,030
He doesn't abandon a single patient
no matter who it is. We owe him so much.

48
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,530
It's like something flashes before your eyes,
and suddenly, your wounds are already healed.

49
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,620
This must be the place.

50
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,000
Hello?

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,210
Whoa!

52
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,220
Why did you come here?

53
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,120
Are you here to take me back?!

54
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,460
Please calm down, Doctor.

55
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,660
I don't want to go back there anymore.

56
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,720
Please, let me go!

57
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,090
No, you've got it all wrong! We just...

58
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,180
Then did you come here to seal my mouth?!

59
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,510
No, we...

60
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,190
You can't trick me!

61
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,530
I'm asking you to please calm down!

62
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,690
Al!!!

63
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,700
I had no idea you were hiding out in the countryside under an assumed name.

64
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,370
I heard a rumor you took some classified documents with you when you disappeared.

65
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,940
I couldn't stand it any longer.

66
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,610
Sure, it was an order from the superiors...

67
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,840
...but because of it, I had to stain my hands by conducting research on such a thing...

68
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,340
"Such a thing"?

69
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,090
So many innocent people died because of it in the civil war in Ishbal...

70
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,600
I can't atone for what I've done, even with my life.

71
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,230
So I decided to become a doctor for this town because I wanted to do all I could to pay for my sins.

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,990
Doctor, what exactly were you ordered to research?

73
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,740
The Philosopher's Stone.

74
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,160
The things I took with me are
the research data and the stone itself.

75
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,750
You have the stone?! Here?!

76
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,060
Isn't that a liquid, not a stone?

77
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,670
"The Philosopher's Stone"...

78
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,160
"The Heavenly Stone"...

79
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,010
"The Great Elixir"... "The Red Tincture"...

80
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,440
"The Fifth Element".

81
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:17,200
They aren't necessarily in the shape of a stone,
just as how the stone itself has many different names.

82
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,130
But this is incomplete.

83
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,040
I don't know when it'll reach its limit and become unusable.

84
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,090
But it definitely displayed its power during the Ishbalan war.

85
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,970
Same with the bogus High Priest of Lior.

86
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,350
His abilities were improved,
even though the stone was incomplete.

87
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:44,480
If something like that can be made,
it's possible to perfect it if we give it more research!

88
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,330
Dr. Marcoh, please show me the research data!

89
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,990
Major... who is this boy?

90
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,910
He's a State Alchemist.

91
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,790
A boy like this...

92
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,270
There were so many alchemists who gave up their state qualifications after the civil war...

93
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,110
...because they couldn't stand being human weapons...

94
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,910
And yet, you...

95
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,390
I know it's stupid!

96
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:21,730
But I'm willing to go through hell until I achieve my goal!

97
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,900
I see... so you broke the taboo...

98
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,500
I'm amazed.

99
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,330
You were able to affix the soul of a human being.

100
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,510
You just might be able to create a perfect Philosopher's Stone.

101
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,700
Then...

102
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,420
I can't show you the data.

103
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,420
But!

104
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,930
You mustn't desire such a thing.

105
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,950
Even if it's to get our bodies back?!

106
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,920
You mustn't!

107
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,330
That is the Devil's research.

108
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,460
You'll see Hell if you study it.

109
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,560
I've seen Hell already!

110
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,190
Sorry. Please, leave...

111
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,480
I've seen Hell already!

112
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,420
Is it really okay?

113
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,100
It's incomplete, but we could have taken at least the stone by force.

114
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,930
Of course I wanted it. I wanted it so badly, but...

115
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:46,150
We don't want to steal the only support the people in this town have in order to get our bodies back.

116
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,140
It's good enough that we found out
a Philosopher's Stone can be created.

117
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,700
We'll look for another way.

118
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,850
But what about you, though?

119
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,660
Don't you have to report Dr. Marcoh to Central?

120
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,940
The person I met today is
a town doctor by the name of Mauro.

121
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,870
Hey!

122
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,460
Dr. Marcoh.

123
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,740
This is where the data is hidden.

124
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,470
If you still feel you won't regret
discovering the truth, take a look.

125
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,730
You may be able to reach
the real truth that is beyond truth...

126
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,030
No... this is unnecessary.

127
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,890
I pray you boys will be able to get your bodies back.

128
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,430
What does it say, Brother?

129
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,540
National Central Library, 1st Branch.

130
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,300
Makes sense. A forest would be
an ideal place to hide a tree, after all.

131
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,930
There are enough books in there to last several lifetimes.

132
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,270
I can find a clue to getting the stone here.

133
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,810
There you are, Marcoh.

134
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,120
Winry! Winry!

135
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,650
You've got an old customer at the door!

136
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,240
Yo, Granny.

137
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,280
We're back!

138
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,300
God, what happened to you two?

139
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,590
A lot. We're going to need your help again.

140
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,710
This is Major Armstrong.

141
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,430
Pleasure to meet you, I'm Pinako Rockbell.

142
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,320
But gosh darn, looks like Ed got shorter after not seeing him for some time.

143
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,190
Hey, I'm pretty sure you're supposed to say "got taller" at times like this...

144
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,950
If you really did, then I'd say so.

145
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,820
What did you say, you minimum hag?!

146
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,820
Didn't I tell you to give me a call
before stopping by for maintenance?!

147
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,870
You trying to kill me, Winry?!

148
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,590
Welcome back!

149
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,780
Yeah.

150
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,250
My bad, my bad. It broke.

151
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,380
"Broke"?

152
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,340
An automail of the highest quality... That I worked so hard on...

153
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,850
Yeah, to smithereens.

154
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,340
And Al is broken, too?

155
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,490
What the heck have you guys been doing?

156
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,080
All you ever do is worry me!

157
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,740
I see.

158
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:56,530
So you want to return to Central as soon as possible to get that data, eh?

159
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,170
Yeah. So I want you to fix me up as quick as you can.

160
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,890
Looks like I'll need to adjust your leg,
too, and not just your arm.

161
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,810
Oh my, seems like you've at least grown a bit.

162
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,430
Shut up!

163
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,930
Unlike your leg though, I'm going to have to remake your arm from scratch.

164
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,530
Will it take a week?

165
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,190
Don't underestimate me.

166
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,440
Three days.

167
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,620
You'll have to bear with a spare for now.

168
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,480
Okay.

169
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,950
It's tough to walk when you're not used to the leg.

170
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,080
I'll fix it up before you get used to it.

171
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,560
But seriously...

172
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,590
Materials... Assembly... Connection... Calibration...

173
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,760
It'll be all-nighters, no doubt.

174
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,580
Sorry for being so unreasonable.

175
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,800
But you want to go back to Central as soon as possible, right?

176
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,090
Then we'll work to make that happen!

177
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,790
But we'll charge extra for the express fee!

178
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,560
It's finished.

179
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,290
Thanks.

180
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,350
I don't see Edward Elric around.

181
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,140
Yeah, he said that he was visiting his mother's grave.

182
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,110
Major.

183
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,400
What kind of lives have those boys been living?

184
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,630
They don't even send us a single letter.

185
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,060
They are famous alchemists, even in Central.

186
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,850
That drags them into trouble, as well...

187
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,150
But don't worry. Those boys are strong.

188
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,240
Are they?

189
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,880
That makes me feel better, at least.

190
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,680
Are those two like grandchildren to you?

191
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,120
I've been watching over them ever since they were born.

192
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,500
Their father was an old drinking buddy of mine,

193
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,920
but he left the village, leaving his wife and children behind.

194
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,160
I don't even know if he's still alive.

195
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,980
Now that I think about it, where are Miss Winry's parents?

196
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,580
They died.

197
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,480
During the Ishbalan war.

198
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,780
My son... her parents... were surgeons.

199
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,990
They left for the battlefield because there was a shortage of doctors, but...

200
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,000
It was a horrible war.

201
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,290
It sure was.

202
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,780
Oh, shucks.

203
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,320
It's about time to start preparing supper.

204
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,730
You look like you'd eat a lot,
so you can expect a big dinner.

205
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,020
Oh no, I can't trouble you any further...

206
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,240
A meal tastes better with more people at the table.

207
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,440
There's an extra bed open for patients, so you can sleep there.

208
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,800
This is the only place those brothers can stay, anyway.

209
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,440
Adding an extra guest won't make a difference.

210
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,820
What about their home?

211
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,450
It's gone.

212
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,140
They don't have a home to return to.

213
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:26,300
They burnt their house down the day Ed decided to leave this village after getting his state qualification.

214
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:33,090
They probably did it to make sure there would be no going back.

215
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,630
Let's go back.

216
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,450
They're all waiting for us.

217
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,150
We're ba-

218
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,070
Edward Elric!

219
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,080
Your innocent love that drove you to attempt to revive your mother!

220
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,640
Your tremendous love that drove you to affix your brother's soul while prepared to throw your own life away!

221
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,260
Your unearthly determination that drove you to destroy your way out by burning down your home filled with memories!

222
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,170
Accept my embrace!!!

223
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,090
Get away! It's too hot!

224
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,400
Stop it!!!

225
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,450
Wow, you guys are at it already! So early in the morning, too!

226
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,760
We've been working all night.

227
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,700
Wow, it's so late and you guys are still working!

228
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,130
You'll be done pretty soon at this rate, won't ya?!

229
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,850
Another all-nighter tonight.

230
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,400
Wha...

231
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,930
Out!

232
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,690
They said they'd get it done in three days, so wait patiently.

233
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:21,630
I know, but I just can't sit still when I know a secret to the Philosopher's Stone lies in Central!

234
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,540
Sorry for the wait! We're done!

235
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,270
You up for this?

236
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,380
Y-Yeah.

237
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,210
Ready...

238
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,130
Set...

239
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,890
Go!

240
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,550
This feeling of connecting my nerves gets me every time.

241
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,560
Well, I won't have to deal with this pain once I get the Philosopher's Stone!

242
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,730
That's too bad. You were a real money-spinner.

243
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,190
Yeah. There's no need to go through the trouble of getting your limbs back!

244
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,010
And besides, what's wrong with this?

245
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,700
The smell of oil, the groaning of bearings...

246
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,560
This beautiful form that was designed based on human engineering!

247
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,790
Ah, how amazing!

248
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,320
Automails, that is!

249
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,660
Machine freak.

250
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,790
Shut up, Alchemy freak.

251
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,340
All right, it's complete!

252
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,090
How is it?

253
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,220
Yeah! Feels great!

254
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,140
We raised the ratio of chromium this time so it would be more resistant to rust.

255
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,970
But that makes it less durable, so don't overuse-

256
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,470
Hey, listen to me!

257
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,560
Al, sorry for the wait!

258
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,560
Will you be able to fix him quickly?

259
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,210
Yeah. There's a trick to it, though.

260
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,200
This seal right here acts as the mediator between Al's soul and this suit,

261
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,490
so I have to make sure I don't mess it up.

262
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,960
There! Perfect!

263
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,590
What do you say we test it out!

264
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,710
Sure!

265
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,090
It'll get quiet around here.

266
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,010
It's finally time!

267
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,850
We're going to go find Dr. Marcoh's data at Central!

268
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,560
We're leaving on the first train tomorrow!

269
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,870
He's sleeping with his belly out, again.

270
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,330
Seriously...

271
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,800
You're like his guardian, Al.

272
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,870
It's a pain having such a needy brother.

273
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,080
How old are you boys now?

274
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,380
I'm fourteen, and Brother is fifteen.

275
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:47,970
He's so short, the same age as me,
and they call him a human weapon?

276
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,570
Look how defenseless he is right now.

277
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,010
Thanks a lot, you two.

278
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,360
What's this formality all of a sudden?

279
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:02,570
You've always welcomed us as family. I'm really thankful of you two.

280
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,020
He might not say it, but Brother feels the same way.

281
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,600
Al...

282
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,750
Hey, we know.

283
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,470
You don't need to say it.

284
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,330
Granny... Winry...

285
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,290
Thank you.

286
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,260
Thanks for everything, Granny.

287
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,090
Sure.

288
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,290
Huh? Where's Winry?

289
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,520
Her last few nights have all been all-nighters, so I bet she's exhausted.

290
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,990
Want me to go wake her up?

291
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,840
Nah, don't worry about it.

292
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,890
She'll just keep on ranting about maintenance and all that stuff.

293
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,770
Later.

294
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,680
Hey, you two.

295
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,530
Stop by for a meal every once in a while, will ya?

296
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,740
We will.

297
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,780
Coming to a place so deep in the mountains just for a meal?

298
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,540
Ed, Al.

299
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,790
Have a safe trip...

300
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,680
Yup!

301
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,360
I slept for the whole day.

302
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,730
Seriously... this place turns into a battlefield whenever he comes.

303
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,970
Oh.

304
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,740
Whoops?

305
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,130
Clues to the Philosopher's Stone are certainly there.

306
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,350
However, the enemy's evil hand has seized its target,

307
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:13,650
and the boys are drawn into a labyrinth by the real truth that is beyond the truth.

308
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,810
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

309
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,810
Episode 7, The Hidden Truth.

310
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,420
If you wish to reach it, you must not avert your eyes.
