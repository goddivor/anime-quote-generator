00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,100
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,690
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,750
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,250
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,870
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,550
One must not commit this act.

7
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:08,860
Marcoh, the man who Ed and Al met, possessed
a Philosopher's Stone, although it was incomplete.

8
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,540
Moved by Ed's passion, Marcoh revealed the location his research data was hidden.

9
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:25,810
And so, after having his automail repaired,
Ed stood before the place Marcoh's data was located...

10
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,660
National Central Library, 1st Branch.

11
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,840
Dr. Marcoh's research data!!!

12
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,090
It was too much effort to look for it,
so I just burnt down the whole building.

13
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,880
What did you do at Central?

14
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,400
That's exactly what I've been explaining to you!

15
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,770
The Fullmetal boy found out about Marcoh's data.

16
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,230
After I took care of that, I came back to East City to check on things, but...

17
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,610
How's he doing?

18
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,480
Gluttony?

19
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,220
I can smell... I can smell it.

20
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,740
There's an Ishbalan nearby that smells like blood.

21
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,510
Can I eat him?

22
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,840
Sure, but eat every bit of him.

23
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,250
There have been no sightings of Scar
since the case involving the Elric brothers.

24
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,650
Maybe he's not in East City anymore?

25
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,130
I need him to be here.

26
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,050
Huh?

27
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,180
If I can solve the case that was left unresolved in Central, it should raise my status in the public's eye.

28
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,450
I'll take advantage of everything I can.

29
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,190
Until I become the FÃ¼hrer and gain full authority over the military, that is.

30
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,070
You ought to refrain from making inappropriate remarks.

31
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,820
Yeah, I'll try.

32
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,240
Excuse me, sir!

33
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,540
There has been a report of an explosion by Merle River!

34
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,510
What?!

35
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,910
A gas explosion?

36
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,980
No idea.

37
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,030
It's been so unsafe lately.

38
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,330
This belongs to Scar. There's no mistaking it.

39
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,560
Have any bodies been found?

40
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,180
We've been searching, but...

41
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,540
In any case, judging from this blood, it is safe to assume that he's dead.

42
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,670
But still, we cannot let our guard down until we confirm his death.

43
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,510
Second Lieutenant Havoc.

44
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:02,940
Sir?

45
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,630
Your squad is to clear all of the rubble.

46
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,490
There will be no breaks, whether it be for lunch or supper.

47
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,810
Drag his body out, no matter what it takes.

48
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,590
Give us a break.

49
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,440
Are you trying to kill us?

50
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,250
Shut up!

51
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,090
I can't even calm myself for a date until I see his dead body with my own eyes.

52
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,010
Yeah, okay.

53
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,270
He got away.

54
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,760
I didn't get to eat him...

55
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,260
There, there, maybe next time.

56
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,100
Well, he probably won't be able to do anything for a while after all that.

57
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,730
I'm going back to Central again.

58
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,900
I need to report to Father about Scar.

59
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,780
Everything's been burnt to a crisp.

60
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,940
Major Armstrong!

61
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,230
Ah, 2nd Lt. Ross and Sergeant Brosh.

62
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,290
What's the matter?

63
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,550
We've received orders from Headquarters to report.

64
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,380
We will take over the escort of Sir Edward Elric.

65
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,420
All right, understood.

66
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:12,300
What the heck?! Just when I thought I'd get rid of this smothering guy for good, I get more escorts?!

67
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,470
There is someone well-versed in the data that was in the Library's 1st Branch.

68
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,180
Although she is no longer employed...

69
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,330
Looks like I shouldn't expect much.

70
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,650
Can I help you?

71
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,400
U-Umm...

72
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,870
Pardon my impudence, but why are you wearing a suit of armor?

73
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,660
Just a hobby!

74
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,070
"Hobby"? Second Lieutenant, what kind of hobby is it?!

75
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,420
What's wrong with these kids?!

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,050
Man, Al, the scenery is great!

77
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,380
You're right, Brother!

78
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,130
Wha-

79
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,100
What's with these mountains of books?!

80
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,320
Is there really someone living here?

81
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,970
Miss Sheska, are you in?

82
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,450
Miss Sheska!

83
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,960
Someone...

84
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,940
Help me...

85
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,110
Huh?

86
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,350
Hm?

87
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,870
Brother, someone...

88
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,700
Someone is buried under the books!

89
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,450
Dig! Dig! Dig! Dig over here!

90
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:18,750
PLACEHOLDER

91
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,380
Idiot!!

92
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,840
Hang in there!

93
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,630
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

94
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,840
I carelessly knocked over a mountain of books...

95
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,010
I thought that was the end for me!

96
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,600
Thank you so much!

97
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,030
So you're Sheska?

98
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:35,910
Yes.

99
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,720
The one who was at the 1st Branch?

100
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,750
1st Branch!

101
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,040
Ah, even the name gives off a sweet sound!

102
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,470
I've always loved books ever since I was born, and I felt like I was being sent to Heaven when I got a job there.

103
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,640
But I forgot that I was at work and was fired because I was reading all the time.

104
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,720
Even though I need a job to send
my sick mother to a better hospital...

105
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:09,420
Seriously... I've got no skills besides reading, and I can't find a job no matter where I go...

106
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,650
That's right! I'm a failure! I'm the trash of society!

107
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,890
Umm... I've got something I want to ask you...

108
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,230
Yes?

109
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,090
Do you happen to know of any
research documents by Tim Marcoh?

110
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,440
Tim Marcoh... Tim Marcoh...

111
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,630
Oh! Yes, I do remember!

112
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,520
Really?!

113
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,490
I remember it clearly because it was handwritten and shoved into a shelf in the wrong section.

114
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,580
So it really was there...

115
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,810
...which means that it's ashes now...

116
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,040
Did you want to read the research?

117
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,970
Yeah, but it's gone now...

118
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,460
Sorry to bother you.

119
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,460
I remember everything in it, though.

120
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,460
What?!

121
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,090
W-Well, I remember the content of every book that I've ever read.

122
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,100
It'll take a while, but would you like me to transcribe it?

123
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,050
Thank you so much, bookworm!

124
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,740
...Worm?

125
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,610
Here is the duplicate of Mr. Tim Marcoh's research!

126
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,990
Sorry, it took five days because there was just so much to write down.

127
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,950
There really are amazing people in this world, aren't there, Brother?

128
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,740
Is this really Dr. Marcoh's research?

129
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,870
Yes! No doubt about it!

130
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,290
"1000 Meals for Daily Living", written by Tim Marcoh.

131
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,200
Huh?

132
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,370
"Add a bit of water to a tablespoon of sugar"...

133
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,840
These really are 1000 meals for daily living.

134
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,880
Hey! What part this makes it an important document?!

135
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,030
But... all I did was copy things down exactly as I'd remembered!

136
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,890
Looks like we just went on a wild goose chase.

137
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,690
This is word for word what Dr. Marcoh wrote, right?

138
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,190
Yes! Without a doubt.

139
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,240
You're amazing. Thanks a lot.

140
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,750
Okay! Let's take this back to the Central Library.

141
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,110
Yeah. They've got a lot of related books there, too.

142
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,780
Yep.

143
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,290
Oops. I need to reward you for all that work.

144
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,250
2nd Lt. Ross, this is my registration code
and silver pocket watch as ID.

145
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,740
Withdraw the amount written on there from
my annual research expenditures and give it to Sheska.

146
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,760
Okay, so I just have to go to the state alchemist facility at the FÃ¼hrer administrative building, right?

147
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,270
Yep!

148
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,010
Thanks again, Sheska!

149
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:28,520
Later!

150
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,780
Hmm, so from his research expenditures...

151
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,690
What's with this number?!

152
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,520
He can just pull out a sum like this as if it's nothing?! What is that boy?!

153
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,040
Are these recipes really research documents for alchemy?

154
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,450
Alchemy is dangerous when abused.

155
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,710
To prevent that, alchemists encrypt their research.

156
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,850
An ordinary person may think it's just a cooking experiment; only the one who wrote it will understand the content.

157
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,750
Basically, it's an advanced alchemy document.

158
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,490
How are you going to decipher it
if only the author can understand it?

159
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,620
Knowledge and inspiration.

160
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,270
The rest of it will all be busy work with patience.

161
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,990
Wow, this'll take a while...

162
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,790
Al, there's something about a pigeon dish!

163
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,120
Pigeon? Could that be...

164
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Yeah.

165
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,670
It could be about the Green Lion. The philosopher's moon.

166
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,790
Did you bring Flamel's manuscripts
or books on Lambspring's philosopher's stone?

167
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,800
Of course!

168
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,740
Great. Hey, look here.

169
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,090
Hmm?

170
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,680
This has to do with it, too, doesn't it?

171
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,880
Yeah, you're right! This one, too.

172
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,840
Yep. All right, let's give it a shot!

173
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,050
Why is this encryption hard as hell...

174
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,280
Don't you think it'll be faster to just ask Dr. Marcoh himself...

175
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,700
No! If we ask him, we lose!

176
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,610
Is that the problem here?

177
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,670
Umm...

178
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,540
Sheska.

179
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,710
I was able to transfer my mother to a wonderful hospital thanks to you.

180
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,270
I really appreciate it.

181
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,470
No problem at all.

182
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,470
Any progress on the decoding?

183
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,850
Have you found a job?

184
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:37,730
But thanks to you two, I realized that even a failure like me can be useful to others.

185
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,740
Thank you so much.

186
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,230
You're not a failure at all.

187
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,040
I believe being able to wholeheartedly commit yourself to something is a talent in itself,

188
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,050
and you have an amazing memory.

189
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,790
You should have more confidence in yourself.

190
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,330
Thanks.

191
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,670
Yo!

192
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,540
Lt. Colonel Hughes!

193
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,590
I heard from Major Armstrong you guys were back.

194
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,300
Come on... I told you guys to come
say hi when you stopped by Central again.

195
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,350
Sorry, I had urgent matters to take care of.

196
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,070
Yeah, I've been kind of busy too...

197
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,990
He's chatting to Lt. Colonel Hughes like they're buddies!

198
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,850
What are those boys?

199
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,170
There's been a lot of incidents and such lately.

200
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,370
The case with Tucker and the chimera hasn't been solved yet, either...

201
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,460
Oh... sorry.

202
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,700
I made you remember it.

203
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,620
Well, you know.

204
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,010
It's busy enough, and the 1st Branch of the library just had to burn down.

205
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,510
The 1st Branch?

206
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:43,130
Yeah. We kept a lot of case records and whatnot in the archives, so it really messes with our job.

207
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,620
Hm? What?

208
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,520
What do you think, Lt. Colonel?

209
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,430
This woman is looking for a job.

210
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,230
Yes, I have read army criminal records and remember them, but...

211
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,520
All right! Let's get you set up right away!

212
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,030
We pay really well!

213
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,330
That's... umm...

214
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,150
Thank you very much!

215
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,150
I'm going to have more confidence in myself, and I'll try my best.

216
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,950
Thank you so much!

217
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,930
Come on! I need you to get to work right away.

218
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,160
What is he, a kidnapper?

219
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,460
"I believe being able to wholeheartedly commit yourself to something is a talent in itself", huh...

220
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,220
Wise words, little bro.

221
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,740
I really feel that way, especially when I look at a certain someone.

222
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:42,310
Then that certain someone's going to keep working hard.

223
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,300
Oops.

224
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,260
Closing time.

225
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,970
It's been ten days already.

226
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,270
I can't believe they have the fortitude
to work every day until this place closes.

227
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,710
Bullshit!!!

228
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,740
Sibling fight?

229
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,820
You shouldn't get desperate simply because you can't solve it...

230
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,170
We did solve it.

231
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,490
We solved the code.

232
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,910
Seriously? That's great!

233
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,280
Hell no, it's not great!

234
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,520
"The Devil's research"...

235
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,470
"Something you mustn't desire"...

236
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,410
I resent you, Dr. Marcoh...

237
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,050
What... exactly...

238
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,080
The ingredients of philosopher's stones...

239
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,470
...are live humans.

240
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,020
And on top of that, you need several sacrifices just to refine one stone.

241
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,840
I would have never thought something so inhumane was going on in the army...

242
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,640
That's something that can't be forgiven.

243
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,660
Could you please not tell anyone about this?

244
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,810
But...

245
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,790
Please!

246
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,660
Forget about it.

247
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,050
What...

248
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,480
The Elric brothers have locked themselves in their room again today?

249
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,800
Yes. They haven't eaten much, either.

250
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,580
Perhaps they were really tired?

251
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,650
Seems they've been working extremely hard these past days, too.

252
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,000
I mean, if that's  what they found after all of that difficult deciphering...

253
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,540
Even I start feeling sick when I start thinking about it.

254
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,610
What is it?

255
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,280
N-Nothing!

256
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,950
Sounds fishy!

257
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,210
Brother, go get something to eat.

258
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,040
I'm not hungry.

259
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,630
This is tough.

260
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,210
Yeah.

261
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,880
It's like...

262
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,510
Right when you get within arm's reach, it runs away...

263
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,700
...and when you finally grab it, it kicks you down.

264
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,650
God must really hate humans who have committed taboo.

265
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,780
I wonder if we'll be like this for the rest of our lives...

266
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,790
Hey... there's something I've always wanted to ask you...

267
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,040
...but I've been too scared to.

268
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,170
What is it?

269
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,900
Elric brothers! You're there, aren't you?

270
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,800
It's me. Open up!

271
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,550
What should we do...

272
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,180
Just ignore him.

273
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,440
I heard the whole story, Edward Elric!

274
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,150
What a tragedy!

275
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,530
To think that such a horrifying secret laid beneath the philosopher's stone!

276
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,110
S... Sorry...

277
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,740
Not much we could do when such
a smothering person approaches you...

278
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,780
To think the army had been doing such a thing...

279
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,500
The truth can be cruel at times.

280
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,210
Truth...

281
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,870
What's wrong, Brother?

282
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,290
Do you remember Dr. Marcoh's words?

283
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,880
Huh?

284
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,760
"You may be able to reach
the real truth that is beyond truth..."

285
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,720
The real truth beyond truth...

286
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,500
Same as a research document for alchemy.

287
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,350
What can be seen from the outside is only a portion of the truth.

288
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,440
There's still something else!

289
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,860
Something...

290
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:00,110
There are currently four alchemy research laboratories owned by the government within Central.

291
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,670
The one Dr. Marcoh belonged to is Research Laboratory 3.

292
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,080
This one is the most suspicious.

293
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:13,770
We went around to every research lab in the city,
but this one wasn't particularly...

294
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,710
This. What's this building?

295
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,150
That would be Research Laboratory 5,
but it's not being used right now.

296
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,430
No one is allowed to enter it due to risk of collapse.

297
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,680
This is the place.

298
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,100
What makes you say that?

299
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,710
There's a prison right next to it.

300
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,230
And...

301
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,940
Do you remember what's needed to create philosopher's stones?

302
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,510
Umm... was it live humans...

303
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,320
There are bound to be people on the death row at the prison.

304
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,450
They tell the public they were executed, and...

305
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,030
Don't tell me... the prisoners are the ingredients?

306
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,290
Don't make that face.

307
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,260
I don't want to think about it, either.

308
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,340
The prison is under a different
jurisdiction, but if it's involved...

309
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,000
Does this mean the government has something to do with it?

310
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,550
I feel like I've stuck my nose into something horrible...

311
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,090
That's why we asked you to forget about it!

312
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,880
This may turn into a political matter.

313
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,940
I'll look into it.

314
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,250
But until then, the 2nd Lt. and
the Sergeant are not to speak of it!

315
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,180
Yes, sir!

316
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,990
You two better not do anything, either.

317
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:28,580
You two were thinking of sneaking into the building to check it out, weren't you!!

318
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,540
We weren't! We weren't!

319
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,900
We were.

320
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,970
A guard at an unused building, eh?

321
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,670
Pretty suspicious.

322
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,620
How should we get in?

323
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,380
How about we just make an entrance?

324
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,090
They'll notice the flash of the transmutation response.

325
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,130
In that case...

326
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,850
Here we... go!

327
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,890
This place is completely shut down, too.

328
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,990
Al, wait here.

329
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,210
Will you be all right on your own?

330
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,520
Either way, you can't get through here with that big body of yours, can you?

331
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,390
Not like I chose to have a big body!

332
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,570
66.

333
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,730
What, 48?

334
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,940
Our first guest in quite a while.

335
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,640
What a reckless dumbass.

336
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,540
This is narrower than I'd thought, dammit.

337
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,210
I probably wouldn't have been able to get through if I was normal-sized.

338
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,830
Good thing I'm small.

339
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,960
Crap! I called myself small!!!

340
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,590
The lights are on.

341
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,470
Not being used right now my ass.

342
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,430
Bingo.

343
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,690
Brother sure is taking his time...

344
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,550
There was a man who held pride in his swordsmanship,

345
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,330
and there was also another man who understood he was a heretic.

346
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,990
The residents of darkness jeer, and
the blades that drank blood are shrieking.

347
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,970
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

348
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,970
Episode 8, Research Laboratory 5.

349
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:23,020
Ones who seek pleasure in fighting and continue to live forever...

350
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,940
...speak thy names.
