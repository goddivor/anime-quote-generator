1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,190
One human only has the power to do so much.

2
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,540
That's why I'm going to protect...

3
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,130
...even if it's just a handful of them...

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,010
...the ones most important to me.

5
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,390
A subordinate protects their subordinate, and so forth.

6
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,070
That should be possible, even for us puny humans.

7
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,390
Geometric progression?

8
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,270
Which means this.

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,560
If you want to protect this whole country,

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,230
you have to be at the top of the summit.

11
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,080
It must feel great up there, Hughes.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,240
But I can't climb to the top with my own strength.

13
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,020
I'm sure of it.

14
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,370
What are you getting all worked up for?

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,870
Sounds interesting.

16
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,850
I'm in.

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,430
I want to see what kind of changes
your naive ideals will bring to this country.

18
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,390
Colonel...

19
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,140
Colonel.

20
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,590
Why not head to the nap room if you're tired?

21
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,930
Yeah... sorry.

22
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,340
I wanted to finish up the documents I've started before I get transferred to Central.

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,110
I haven't slept much lately.

24
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,330
It seemed you were dreaming about something.

25
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,430
WHat? Just a boring flashback.

26
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,600
I don't remember anything after being kicked by this guy.

27
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,370
"Guardians with only souls",
"precious sacrifices", "being kept alive".

28
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,930
"Tattoo of Ouroboros", and
"transmutation circle for a philosopher's stone".

29
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,860
According to Dr. Marcoh,
the stones were used in Ishbal, as well...

30
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,050
There are too many mysteries for it to be an ordinary experiment.

31
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,080
I'd like to look into it some more,
but the research lab is in ruins now.

32
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Hmm...

33
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,710
Seems like they're discussing something tricky...

34
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,130
I don't feel like getting involved in something dangerous again, so I refuse to listen!

35
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,880
Hey, you two...

36
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,810
Is this the Fullmetal Alchemist's recovery room?

37
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,340
Yes, he's in here...

38
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,890
We may be able to discover something if we look through the court-martial chamber.

39
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,880
I'll go and investigate the ones who were participating in the research of the stones under Dr. Marcoh.

40
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,900
Sorry to intrude.

41
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,010
F-FÃ¼hrer-President... King Bradley!

42
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,030
Quiet down. You can be at ease.

43
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,170
Your Excellency, may I ask why you are here?

44
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,850
Why I'm here?

45
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,590
To visit this boy, of course.

46
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,250
Are you fond of melon at all?

47
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,740
Oh... thank you.

48
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,550
Wait, something's wrong here!

49
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,290
Seems like you've been doing a lot of investigating of the military leadership, Major Armstrong.

50
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,300
Huh?! Well... that's...

51
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,860
How did you...

52
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,110
Don't underestimate my intelligence network.

53
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,320
And you, Edward Elric...

54
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,170
The philosopher's stone, right?

55
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,040
Just how much did you find out?
Depending on that, I may have to...

56
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,170
I'm joking!

57
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,590
No need to get tense.

58
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,760
What?

59
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,050
I, too, was aware there have been
disquieting activities within the military.

60
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,040
I've always wanted to do something about them, but...

61
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,950
Oh, that's...

62
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,400
A list of people who were researching the philosopher's stones, eh?

63
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,710
Every one of them has been reported missing.

64
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,280
What?!

65
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,550
They have been reported missing a few days prior to the destruction of Research Laboratory 5.

66
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,460
The enemy is always ahead of us.

67
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,250
Even with my intelligence network,
we still don't know the scale of it all,

68
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,050
their objectives, or how close they are to achieving them.

69
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,710
So you're saying it's extremely dangerous for us to look into it.

70
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,830
That's right.

71
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,700
Lt. Colonel Hughes,

72
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,600
Major Armstrong,

73
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,290
Elric Brothers,

74
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,690
I've decided you all are trustworthy people.

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,440
I forbid you to continue investigating this matter or to disclose it to others!

76
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,700
You cannot trust anyone in a situation like this,
when you cannot even distinguish friend from foe!

77
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,690
Regard all of the military as your foe and proceed carefully!

78
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,220
However...

79
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,120
When the time comes, I will have many tasks for all of you.

80
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,290
So be prepared.

81
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,370
Yes, sir!

82
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,180
Your Excellency!

83
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,350
Where have you gone, Your Excellency?!

84
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,930
Ah, drats! Here comes my annoying subordinate.

85
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,920
I snuck out of my office, after all.

86
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,880
Farewell!

87
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,660
Hey, Ed.

88
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,230
Huh?

89
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,580
What are you guys doing?

90
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,160
Let's just say... a storm just went by.

91
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,280
I went out and bought the tickets you asked for.

92
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,410
Tomorrow's afternoon train, right?

93
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,750
Yeah, thanks.

94
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,200
Why are you in such a rush?
Your wounds haven't even healed yet.

95
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,800
I can't stay in a place reeking of antiseptics like this forever.

96
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,200
Where are you going this time?

97
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,800
Dublith?

98
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,030
Yeah.

99
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,760
After discussing it with Al, we decided to stop by our master's place.

100
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,600
I'm scared, Brother...

101
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,660
We're probably going to get killed!

102
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,530
C-Courage, my little brother!

103
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,280
I'm just as scared as you are!

104
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,820
What kind of person is your master...

105
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,940
Dublith is quite far from here.

106
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,240
Where is it?

107
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,000
Let's see... It's here. It's right in the middle of the South.

108
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,630
W-What?!

109
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,510
This place! Before Dublith!

110
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,720
The Holy Land of Automails, Rush Valley!

111
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,510
I've always wanted to go there!

112
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,140
Please take me! Please take me!

113
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,920
Take me! You better take me!

114
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,770
Why don't you go by yourself?

115
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,020
Who's going to pay for the trip, then?

116
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,720
You're planning on making me  pay for it?!

117
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,280
Sure, why not? It's on the way, after all.

118
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,360
I guess it's okay...

119
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,900
Hooray!

120
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,660
I'm going to give Granny a call!

121
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,050
Yeah, she'll make a grand wife.

122
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,550
Don't tell me  that!

123
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,930
Not as grand as my wife, though!

124
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,840
Well, Papa's going to be on his way!

125
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,970
Are you going to come home early today, Papa?

126
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,450
Hmm, I wonder?

127
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,470
Papa's got a lot of work to do!

128
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,470
But I'll come home as soon as I can!

129
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,350
You're going to be late.

130
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,520
You're going to be leaving today, right, Winry?

131
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,700
I can't see you off because of work, so...

132
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,150
Take care of yourself.

133
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,570
I'm truly indebted to you, Mr. Hughes.

134
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,860
Be sure to drop by if you ever come to Central again.

135
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,280
Think of it as your home.

136
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,040
And give my regards to those boys, too.

137
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,710
Okay!

138
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,190
Good luck at work, Papa!

139
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,590
See you!

140
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,270
Why did you decide to go visit your master all of a sudden?

141
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,850
Two reasons.

142
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,540
First off, we've kind of been on a losing streak.

143
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,430
What?!

144
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,490
You're going because you want to get stronger?!

145
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,860
What are you guys, muscleheads?

146
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,720
Idiot! It's not that simple!

147
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,430
We don't just want to get stronger physically, but should we say mentally, too...

148
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,990
Right?

149
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,650
Yeah.

150
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,750
Anyway, we feel like we'll be able to get stronger if we visit our master.

151
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,750
I want to become far stronger than I am now.

152
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,380
And your second reason?

153
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,510
I want to ask about philosopher's stones.

154
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,870
The real truth that is beyond truth...

155
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,590
We never found out the meaning of those words, after all.

156
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,400
Our master might know something about it.

157
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,610
We can't be caring about how we're going to look out there.

158
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,180
We're going to ask our master while being prepared to be killed...

159
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,290
Ask...

160
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,330
Ask...

161
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,000
It was a short-lived life.

162
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,380
I wish I could have had a girlfriend, at least...

163
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,540
What kind of person is your master?

164
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,670
A riot in Lior?

165
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,580
Yes.

166
00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:01,280
Apparently, the riot caused by some Leto cult
deceiving the citizens has finally calmed down.

167
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,550
I see...

168
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,680
With Ishbal and other riots...
the East sure have their hands full.

169
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,150
Not just the East, but there are riots and border wars
sparking up in the North and the West.

170
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,630
Mountains of corpses everywhere, huh...

171
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,840
We may even get a coup soon...

172
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,280
Where are you headed, Lt. Colonel?

173
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,980
To the library.

174
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,080
Riots throughout Lior.

175
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,800
The ingredients of philosopher's stones are humans...

176
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,300
What we did in Ishbal...

177
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,680
Whoa now, who's the mastermind behind all of this?

178
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,980
I've got to hurry and let the FÃ¼hrer-President know...

179
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,160
Nice to meet you, Lt. Colonel Hughes.

180
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,320
Or should I say... farewell?

181
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,090
Cool tattoo you've got there.

182
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,510
You found out too much, Lt. Colonel Hughes.

183
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,270
Dammit...

184
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,240
That's something I  should be saying.

185
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,330
Oh, Lt. Colonel Hughes.

186
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,710
If you're here to call someone about your family again-

187
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,460
Lt. Colonel, you're bleeding!

188
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,550
It's nothing. I need to use the phone...

189
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,630
I need to call the FÃ¼hrer-President building...

190
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,690
Sorry to bother you...

191
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,120
Lt. Colonel!

192
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,950
Hello? You've reached Eastern Headquarters.

193
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,860
Let me talk to Roy... Colonel Roy Mustang.

194
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,950
We're not permitted to relay direct calls from an outside line.

195
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,030
I'm Lt. Colonel Hughes from Central!

196
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,910
I'm calling from a phone booth because of an emergency!

197
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,180
Please give me the code.

198
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,200
What a bother!

199
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,340
Uncle-Sugar-Oliver-Eight-Zero-Zero!

200
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,860
I've verified the code.

201
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,310
One moment, please.

202
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,540
Hurry up!

203
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,800
The military is in danger!

204
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,280
Could you put down the receiver, Lt. Colonel?

205
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,020
The receiver, please.

206
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,370
2nd Lt. Ross... or not.

207
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,400
Who are you?

208
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,290
I'm 2nd Lt. Maria Ross. Have you forgotten?

209
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,410
No, you're not.

210
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,400
2nd Lt. Ross has a mole under her left eye!

211
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,680
Huh? Really?

212
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,560
I was careless.

213
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,540
How's this?

214
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,800
What the hell...

215
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,820
It's as if I'm dreaming.

216
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,180
Your quick-wittedness brought the end of you, Lt. Colonel Hughes.

217
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,570
Hey now, give me a break.

218
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,600
I've got a wife and a daughter waiting for me at home.

219
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,440
There's no way...

220
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,560
...I can die here!

221
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,400
Perfect staging, right?

222
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,110
Damn you!!!

223
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,630
Lt. Colonel Hughes from Central is on a public line.

224
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,930
Again?

225
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,310
Put him through.

226
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,520
It's me.

227
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,840
If it's about your daughter again, I'm hanging up.

228
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,220
Hughes?

229
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,730
Hughes...

230
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,050
Hey, Hughes!

231
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,400
Humans are so foolish.

232
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,820
Risking their lives for something so stupid.

233
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,780
Elicia... Gracia...

234
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,640
I'm sorry...

235
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:45,340
I don't think I can... keep my promise...

236
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,220
Wow, this is delicious!

237
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,100
These apple pies are awesome!

238
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,460
Miss Gracia is such a good cook!

239
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,880
I know that.

240
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,980
The quiche she made for us once was really good.

241
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,420
It's on my "list of things to eat when I get my body back".

242
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,790
She taught me how to make it, so I'll bake one for you when you get your body back, Al.

243
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,370
Yay!

244
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,250
Mr. Hughes and Miss Gracia are both wonderful people.

245
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:27,260
Lt. Colonel Hughes is such a doting father...
and kind of annoying because he's so meddlesome.

246
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,760
He always came to poke fun at you in your hospital room, didn't he?

247
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,410
Seriously.

248
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,640
He's always saying he's busy with work, yet he paid me a visit every day.

249
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,440
We have to thank him next time.

250
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,520
Yeah.

251
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,850
Mama... why are they burying Papa?

252
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,330
Elicia...

253
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,420
Papa won't be able to go to work if they do that.

254
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,960
Elici...

255
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,250
Papa said he had a lot of work to do!

256
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,490
Stop!

257
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,720
Don't bury him!

258
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,850
Papa!!!

259
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,670
Specially promoted two ranks after being killed in the line of duty.

260
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,830
Brigadier General Hughes... huh?

261
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,540
You said you were going to work under me and support me.

262
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,460
What's the point if you surpass my rank?

263
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,110
Idiot...

264
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,340
Colonel.

265
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,730
Alchemists are unpleasant creatures, aren't they, Lieutenant?

266
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm desperately putting together the theory of human transmutation in my head.

267
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:20,620
I feel like I know how those boys felt when they tried to transmute their mother.

268
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,120
Are you all right?

269
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah.

270
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,000
Ah, it looks like it's beginning to rain.

271
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,830
No, I don't think so...

272
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,770
No, it's raining all right.

273
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,950
You're right.

274
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,750
Let's go back.

275
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,040
We'll catch colds.

276
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,070
He left the room saying that
he was going to go to the library.

277
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,570
That was the last I saw of the Lt. Colonel.

278
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,920
Did he fight with someone in here?

279
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,220
Most likely.

280
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,320
There were bloodstains from the room to the hallway.

281
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,250
And his next destination was...

282
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,380
Lt. Colonel tried to make a phone call,
even while he was injured...

283
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,880
But... he left without doing so.

284
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,450
He realized something in the court-martial chamber...

285
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:31,140
...and took the trouble to contact me from the outside when he could have called from within the building.

286
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,170
The telephone operator in the Eastern Headquarters heard Hughes say, "The military is in danger".

287
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,280
What is it?

288
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What was he trying to tell me?

289
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,970
Colonel, I've brought Major Armstrong.

290
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,860
We have an idea of the ones who murdered Lt. Colonel Hughes.

291
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,800
Then why don't you take them into custody?!

292
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,180
We have an idea, but we don't know exactly who they are.

293
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,180
What do you mean? Tell me in detail.

294
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,180
I cannot.

295
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,530
I, a Colonel, am telling you to speak.

296
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,060
Are you going to disobey a senior officer?!

297
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,060
I cannot speak.

298
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,680
Understood.

299
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,520
Sorry for calling you out here.

300
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,660
You may go.

301
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,540
Yes, sir.

302
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,330
Sir, I forgot to mention.

303
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,210
The Elric Brothers had been staying here until a few days ago.

304
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,460
The Elric Brothers?

305
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,840
Yes, the Elric Brothers.

306
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,220
Did they find what they were looking for?

307
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,440
No.

308
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,720
What they are looking for is almost legendary.

309
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,600
I see. Thanks.

310
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,320
We couldn't get much out of him, could we?

311
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,110
Seriously...

312
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,840
The Major is truly good-natured.

313
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,690
He said specifically,
"ones who murdered Lt. Colonel Hughes".

314
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,580
Which means there were several.

315
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,620
It could be that they're working as an organization.

316
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,840
If he can't speak, even under order from a colonel,

317
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,010
that means someone higher ranked than me is imposing silence on him.

318
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,010
We can assume the top of the military is behind it.

319
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,010
And the thing the Elric Brothers are looking for...

320
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,890
In other words, the philosopher's stone.

321
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:41,060
An organization that has a hand in the military leadership, the philosopher's stone, and Lt. Colonel Hughes...

322
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,940
Just how does it all relate...

323
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,550
As for now, we don't know.

324
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:52,660
But once I get transferred to Central, I'll investigate the leadership and find out who killed Hughes.

325
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,250
It's unlike you to mix up private and public matters.

326
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,290
There are no "private" or "public" matters involved.

327
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,650
Aiming to become FÃ¼hrer-President and avenging Hughes' death...

328
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,050
...are both my will as an individual.

329
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,550
Our target will be the military leadership. You're coming with me, right?

330
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,810
Like I'll back down now.

331
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:04,420
Ed and Al run through Rush Valley, chasing after Paninya, a girl who stole Ed's silver pocket watch,

332
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,700
although they have no idea what's awaiting them.

333
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,430
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

334
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:19,430
Episode 11, The Miracle at Rush Valley.

335
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,350
The words the boy engraved were words of resolve.

336
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,590
Or could they be...
